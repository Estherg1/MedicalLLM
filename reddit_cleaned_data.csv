0,Leg pain after 4ml IM injection,"I'm a regular user of anabolic steroids, peptides, etc. 5 days ago I injected 4ml of a testosterone that had the concentration level of 500mg/ml. It had about 3% Benzyl Alcohol added to it and was filtered through a 0.22nm nylon filter.

The next day, I couldn't walk. I have swelling at the injection site and around/above my knee cap. It's very, very difficult to walk, and the pain is near unbearable if my leg isn't elevated/at level with my body; so I've been near bed ridden for the past 4 days.

Symptoms: Swelling, slight redness at injection site, warmth from injection site, spontaneous (what I can only describe as) muscle spasms; a few times a day, whether going to the bathroom or lying in bed not moving, my quadricep will twitch/spasm. Injection site is very 'tough' and 'hard'; tissue scarring? 

There is no visible abscess. I don't have a fever. No difficulty in breathing or elevated heart rate. No vomiting. My appetite seems a bit suppressed, but could be because of the heat we're experiencing. I did have a nose bleed yesterday but that could've been from my mild hay fever. Tensing my leg is pretty much impossible. Bending my leg at the knee to any acute angle is impossible; feels like my knee and injection site has massive pressure on them. I've been sleeping with my leg slightly elevated, trying to keep off it (probably only spending about 10 minutes on my feet a day).

I've been taking ibuprofen for pain/inflammation but doesn't help.

Basically my two problem areas are at injection site, around upper/outer kneecap (where the quad ends?).

I'll be going to my doctor Monday.


I used a 1.25"" 25g needle, area swabbed with an alcohol prep pad before injection. I inject 4-5ml often (though it's been about 4 months since I injected either of my quads, keeping it to delts, pecs and glutes).

Any possible insight would be appreciated.","Although I don't know anything about the creator, I think it is actually a pretty neat subreddit which I so far have enjoyed partaking in. I'm currently studying for my USMLE Step 2 CK (medical boards) and it's a nice academic distraction from my studies (yet I'm still studying by attempting to answer people's questions). As far as your situation goes, I must agree partially with KentGrz, but I am still leaning more towards cellulitis/infection. I understand you don't currently have systemic signs of infection (fever, elevated heart rate, etc.) but that could be 2/2 the steroids reducing the inflammatory response and also the NSAIDS you are taking for the pain. There may be no abscess for a considerable period, but what you describe sounds like a very indurated region that may potentially become one later. And you are correct that most likely a good course of antibiotics should do the trick. Get well soon!  "
1,"Exhausted, out of breath","Hi everyone, Today I went to another city with my mother and a friend of hers. The man is 58 of age and can't walk more then 20 meters without being totally incapable of continuing to walk by being out of breath completely and exhausted. He has this inhaler he has to use which he got from a doctor, but the inhaler doesn't do a damn thing as it's the same story 5 minutes later. I noticed he doesn't breath like it should, slow and under control. He takes big gasps trough his nose with each breath he takes, you can see his whole torso move with each breath. We talked about it, he says his doctor told him to stop smoking, eventho he hasn't been a hard smoker, and only smokes about 3 sigarettes a day now. It's been stated before by some specialist that his lung capacity is smaller, but I've honnestly never seen a grown man struggle that bad over such small distances. They checked his blood, rayed his lungs, they say he's fine and in good condition. I however can't bear to see him suffer in this way, I wonder if this is a known thing? Are these doctors of him ignoring other possibilities? I guess what I would like to know, is that if there is medication for shortness of breath other then cheap asmatic inhalers that don't work. And if there is a way to progresively increase his lung capacity? He is a very frail man that had some rough injuries if it interests. Thank you for your time.","Sounds like he has COPD since you say his lung capacity is smaller and he has a history of smoking. I'm sure his doctors have also worked him up for congestive heart failure and other causes of shortness of breath. The inhaler will only do so much for him, especially if he continues to smoke. COPD is a debilitating disease and I'm sorry that you have to experience it through a friend, but it is also a progressive disease and there is not much that can be done to reverse his situation. If he does worsen however, he needs to seek medical attention as he may need steroids added to his medication regimen."
2,Do these symptoms mean I should get a colonoscopy?,"My question is about the necessity of a colonoscopy and the sensible timeline for getting one.

I'm 24 and have been having bowel disturbances for about five months -- frequent (at least 4-6 times/day) bowel movements, bloating and gas every evening, and about once a month or two some light rectal bleeding. Besides bloating dull ache, I feel occasional sharp pain in my lower left abdomen. 

Have done tests to rule out common viral/bacterial infections and ulcerative colitis and tried IBS medicine for a month (not much help). 

Saw bowel specialist who is having me get some blood work and another pathogen test done. He recommended a colonoscopy to check for inflammation.

Now, I'm from the US but currently work in New Zealand and would have to pay for the colonoscopy (about $1500-2000) out of pocket if I get it done here. If I wait until I come home in December, my US insurance would probably cover it.

I'm hoping for advice on any danger there could be in waiting. I guess I've gotten used to the symptoms and have found that changing my diet alleviates them a bit. If symptoms go away, would it be a bad idea to forego a colonoscopy all together?

I've read stories about younger people getting bowel cancer and having it go undetected because it's seen as a disease older people get, so that's in the back of my mind.

Complicating or perhaps explaining all this, I was on two courses of antibiotics for unrelated infections during the last four months and three other courses in the past year....and I have had severe food allergies all my life to dairy, nuts and shellfish. When I was younger I had minor allergies to wheat and soy.

I cut soy and wheat out of my diet in the past week and have found some symptoms have improved a bit.





","Is there any family history of colon cancer or any other colon pathology? Describe the stool for us. There are times when younger patients do get colonoscopies (e.g. if you have HNPCC or Lynch syndrome, screening can start as early as 25 y.o or if you have a family hx of colon cancer). Your bowel specialist is correct in recommending a colonoscopy. I have no idea how ulcerative colitis was ruled out without having the colonoscopy w/ biopsies (bloodwork for ASCA and ANCA usually are done only if the diagnosis is not clear in IBS)."
3,How can I fight my Rosacea problem,I am a 21 year old male turning 22 next month. I have been fighting Acne Rosacea for around 8 years. I have had times when my face was all red and flaky while at other times not so bad. I'm desperately looking for a way to get rid of this as it greatly affects my social life. I have tried all sorts of moisturizing creams and oils but nothing seems to have a permanent solution to this problem. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could tell me how they have had to overcome this problem because 8 years is a long time and I don't want it to continue for another 8 or more.,"Rosacea is a difficult dermatological condition. Creams and oils applied on the affected area can actually be a trigger/cause of the inflammation. As with most dermatology problems, try to use products that have the best record of non-irritability e.g. ""cetaphil"" type products. One thing you could try if you haven't already is to instead of sleeping on a pillow directly, use a clean towel that you launder everyday with just water and plain bleach and sleep on that on top of your pillow. It's often a recommended tip for acne vulgaris, but it's quite applicable in this situation as all you are trying to do is limit your contact time of your face with things that may irritate it, including a dirty pillow."
4,Thought I was going to die yesterday.,"I (33 M) was standing in the kitchen yesterday when a wave of dizziness, high bp and heart rate came over me. I couldn't stand, and basically fell to he floor. My wife called an ambulance right away. Lying on the floor, I remained conscious, but really dizzy and I thought I might pass out at any moment. There was a persistent tingling in both my hands. I was scared for my life at this time.

The EMT's came and took my pressure. It was at 163/120 and my rate was at 123 (if I remember correctly). I was taken to hospital, and there I had to wait for 7 hours before seeing a doctor. All this time I felt dizzy, and sometimes it came in stronger. 

They did a complete bloodwork, urine, ecg, and a chest x-ray. Everything was normal there, well as normal as you'd expect from a smoker who drinks a bit more than average. 

I was discharged, went home and slept. Right now I feel a bit weak. I feel a lot better then yesterday, but a little light-headed and weak.

I got to thinking that my anxiety may have been a factor here, but I am no doctor, so that's why I am writing this.

What I am hoping for is a possible explanation for what happened, because when my tests came back negative, it left me a bit nervous.

If any additional info is needed, I'll provide through a PM.","There's a difference between panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. They are two different diagnosis even though they have similarities and it's very difficult to say which one you may have. I would suggest that when you do visit your doctor, especially if it is a GP, to ask politely to be referred to a psychiatrist to get this properly diagnosed as the treatment does vary slightly. I'm not so up to date on DSM V because it just came out a couple months ago, but I did recently finish my psych rotation and I'm leaning more towards panic disorder especially when you mentioned ""hoping for a possible explanation/negative tests left you more nervous"". A pt w/ panic disorder characteristically has anxiety secondary to fear of having the next panic attack."
5,Daughter is teething and I don't know what this is.,"[Tooth](http://imgur.com/FNgqsaX) in question. Wife sent me this picture of our daughter saying she thinks the little pointed tip is a nerve, making an dentist app first thing monday morning. Did not find any information on google so I figured I'd come here. Also, Thank you guys for this sub. ","Can you possibly circle the area in question? As a med student we don't get much exposure to dentistry, but as far as I can see everything looks completely normal. All I see is erupting teeth... I can't even tell which ones since during my Peds rotation I usually count from the incisors (the front two) and I don't see those."
6,Fainted the other night... should I be worried?,"So background info first: I'm 21 y/o male, 170lbs, athletic and in good shape. No real past medical history.

So the other night I was out drinking with my apartmentmates. We got drunk before we left and went out to a bar. I had one beer while I was there. This was, by no means, a very drunk night for me - I probably had 8 beers over the course of 4 or 5 hours.

At about 2:00, we hit the McDonalds down the block and were planning on going to another place afterwards (bars close at 3am here). I was feeling fine - we each got some McNuggets and as I was eating them, I started feeling a little lightheaded. A couple minutes later, my vision just tunnel vision-ed to black. I stood there for a few seconds, rather alarmed, before I was like ""guys fuck I can't see anything."" Next thing I know, I woke up slumped down against the wall and people were standing around me. I got up and found a seat and we sat down (after a thoughtful ""keep an eye on him"" from the security guard) and we got a cab home and I was fine for the rest of the night. I was really sweaty after it happened but that went away within like 20 mins. 

I have no idea how this happened. I ate breakfast lunch and dinner. I remember everything, except for the 1-2 minutes between when I couldn't see and when I woke up on the floor. The only thing that I could possibly think it could be is dehydration, because I didn't have much to drink all day. But I thought that the dehydration effect of alcohol took a little longer to sink in since I'd had a lot of fluids and my urine wasn't bright yellow or anything. Again, I wasn't that drunk. I've been much more intoxicated, and nothing like this has ever happened.

TLDR: Passed out for seemingly no reason. WebMD seems to think I might have MS, but that seems unlikely so I figured I'd ask.","Uhhh I agree... nothing about your background even fits MS demographics (F, 30's-40's, episodes of neurological problems varying from weakness, sensory, to cognitive problems over the course of a long period of time). I'd just be more careful of monitoring if anyone put anything in your drink while you were out. - 4th year med student w/ lots of personal experience =P"
7,Bug Bite or Should I see a Doctor?,"http://i.imgur.com/orRFLyX.jpg

Found this bump on my elbow today, looks like a bug bite and I have been out around parks and foresty areas lately, the only thing that concerns me is that when I squish it its softer than most bug bites, like more squishy whereas things like mosquito, fly, and wasp bites are usually kind of hard and painful to touch. Just want to get a second opinion, thanks!","I think your intuition is quite accurate. Most bites from insects are usually firm and indurated 2/2 inflammation; when you say it is squishy, it almost sounds more fluctuant like a potentially developing abscess. Regardless of what it may be, it doesn't seem to emergent or life threatening. I'd get a sharpie and outline the erythematous area where the redness meets your normal skin color and watch it for growth within the next day. Can you describe whether it is itchy or painful? My only concern would be if it begins to ulcerate, then I'd go seek care. Certain species of spiders have hemolytic toxins that can cause some pretty bad necrotic ulcers (e.g brown recluse bites) that can potentially become disfiguring if not managed early w/ debriedement."
8,Few questions regarding my heart.,"Hey everyone here, thanks for being available!

Basic info:

~130lbs
~Age 21

Okay, so first of all, I've never felt my heart as much as I do now. It is extremely strange and sort of hard to describe.

One symptom is an occasional tightness in the region of my heart. It doesn't last very long, nor does it hurt very much, but it's enough for me to to notice and feel uncomfortable.

Second, sometimes I feel it beating abnormally hard. I was a swimmer in high school, but it has been a while since I have regularly worked out. At this point, it just feels like it is beating too hard for what I am doing. This is seldom, but seems to accompany the tightness.

Third, it feels like it is beating too fast as well. Again, this is not all the time, but enough for me to notice.

I've read up on dehydration possibly causing these symptoms and I am trying to drink more water recently but I'm still feeling these them.

Thanks to all those out there who answer, and if you need any more info feel free to ask. I'd really like to hear some useful information before I decide if I want to go get it checked out.","There's more questions that need answering that would help a little bit. Especially demographics:
M/F, ethnicity. Do you have any nausea when these events occur? At any time did you feel like passing out? Is there anything you can think of that coincides w/ the tightness such as a trigger? Any recent new stressors in your life? Any medications you are currently on (lots of teens are overdiagnosed w/ ADD and are on amphetamines)? There's a bunch more, but Dvdrummer360 pretty much has the correct final answer regardless of what we help diagnose you with... you need a full workup. Could be anything that is causing what sounds like palpitations... anxiety, hyperthyroidism, etc. "
9,"Strange rash, I suppose, on my girlfriend's leg","http://imgur.com/7oV1ybM
We were out in the woods exactly a week ago and she
started getting these bumps on her leg. The entirety of the
rash was originally smaller and closer to her skin tone. Now 
it's around 3/4's an inch and she doesn't want to go to a doctor, 
Should she?","It is possible that it is poison oak, but it's more likely something else just based off my experience with lots of poison oak in the years I was on search and rescue for our county. Was she ever exposed to poison oak before? Because the reaction to poison oak is a type IV hypersensitivity (it just means that she needs to have prior exposure for her body to make cells that will mount a response during the second exposure). If this is her first time ever even possibly touching the urushiol oils of poison oak, then her body is naive and would not be able to mount a response. It is still definitely possible that it is some form of contact dermatitis. If it has not diminished by a week from now I would say it wouldn't hurt to get it checked out!"
10,"Pain in right side of the chest, high heart rate, nausea, headache, fatigue and dizziness. Do I need to see a doctor?","For the past two days I've been having the symptoms that I described in my title. 

I've generally been pretty relaxed so I don't think it's anxiety and I'm really at a loss. 

The pain in my chest alternates between stabbing, pressure and barely anything at all, it comes and goes. I tried taking paracetamol but it didn't really do much. 

My mom thinks I should go get checked out by a doctor tomorrow but I thought I would check here first to see if I really need to go or whether I should just wait it out. 

Thanks in advance :)","Some demographics please (e.g. Age, F/M, ethnicity). Does anything make the chest pain worse or better? Does the pain ""travel"" to anywhere? By dizziness do you mean lightheadedness, or is the room spinning (i.e vertigo)? Any fever or chills? Any problems lying down flat at night? Do you ever wake up from coughing at night or have history of heartburn or GERD?"
11,Abdominal pain for months,"I don't have health insurance while not in school and when I was the school doctors were unhelpful. I've had pain in my lower abdomen for several months now and its always been hard to describe. I've had an appendectomy ~4 years ago and the pain is mostly on the left side anyway so I can safely rule that out. In the beginning I suspected a soy protein intolerance or some such thing as the ingredient ""soy protein isolate"" or soy in larger quantities gave me intense discomfort. (I grew up with soy as a replacement for milk as I have anaphilaxis, so the soy problem was new and has not been professionally diagnosed) Since then I've avoided soy but the pain has never really gone away and now it feels like my insides are sore and has been harder to ignore. No amount of poking or prodding (that the doctors did way back when or when I try now) produces any abnormal pain. The pain is generally between the hips and belly button tending towards the left side. I've also noticed difficulty urinating despite the urge to do so. I suspect the answer is ""Go see a real doctor"" but financially this is not really a viable option. I guess I'm looking for a possible diagnosis or steps I can take on my own to ""heal"" what ever this is.",Can you please let us know some demographics first? F/M and age is extremely important in abdominal differentials.
12,"Strep Throat(?) not reacting to Antibiotics, throat extremely swollen.","Approximately 8 days ago, I started having a sore throat. Very minor, just enough to notice, assumed it was a cold. Fast forward to Tuesday (3 days ago), I woke up with extreme discomfort in my throat, headache, stomach ache, and when I used a flashlight to look down my throat, I could see some white blotches on my tonsils. I go to the doctors, he does a rapid strep test, which did not register for strep, so he sent a throat culture to the lab. But he said it was probably strep, so he prescribed  Z-pak for me, as I am allergic to Penicillin.

It has only gotten worse. While the stomach and head ache's are gone,my throat is very swollen, my uvula and tonsils have become one swollen, sore covered mass, and I cannot eat anything remotely solid. I just took the 4th set of Z-pak pills (2 pills, once a day). Doc was suppose to call yesterday with lab results, I will be calling today.

To make things even more difficult, I'm am currently transitioning between healthcare providers, and I found out on Tuesday that coverage from my first provider has already ceased, and the new one does not start until August 1st. I'm almost hesitant to go in again, and get hit with a huge bill if it is something worse.

Any ideas?",There isn't much additional advice I can give you. Your doctor has followed a very standardized protocol. The fact that the azithromycin is not working for you indicates that the infection may be more viral in nature. During my peds rotation it was extremely difficult to tell what was Strep and what was mononucleosis (usually caused by EBV or CMV- both viruses) cause the presentation can be very similar. What are your demographics? If you are between 16-25 yo the chances of it being mono is much higher than it being strep throat. Both mono and strep can have those white blotches (exudates) and both present very similarly. Do you have any abdominal tenderness especially in the left upper quadrant? I highly recommend you to avoid contact sports for at least 2-3 wks or until your doc lets you know what he thinks. People infected with mono have splenomegally (enlarged spleen) and are prone to splenic ruptures if even a little rough with their body. 
13,Are these symptoms related?,"I don't have insurance at the moment because it won't kick in until September but something is worrying me...

I popped a vein in my right wrist a couple days ago by trying to bang in my daughter headboard that was coming apart. Immediately my vein began swelling and you could see that is was bleeding, now it is really bruised about 3 inches all around my wrist. Yesterday (the day after the incident) I got a HORRIBLE headache. I have never had pain like that before, I laid down when I went to bed and was awoken by the pain twice. I took 3 ibuprofen and it did not help at all. The pain was mainly above my eyes and across my forehead. I am wondering if these things are related or if there is any cause for concern... 

Thank you for any help or advice you can give.","Sorry for getting back to you so long after the event occurred, but do you still have said pain in your head?"

16,Do splinters come out on their own?,"I've got a splinter in my finger today in camp, and the medic told me that it should come out on its own after two-three days to one week. Some people thought I should take it out with tweezers after making a cut with a needle, but others insisted it will come out on its own. It's a bit deep in.","If it is superficial, it is not really concerning as yes, it will over time come out on its own. If it is deep as you said, the main concern would be for infection as wood is a porous material and it would not be ideal to be left in a deep wound. Did you bleed at all when you got the splinter? If you did, I would consider it deep enough to be problematic and get a medical professional to remove it."
17,Battling BV,"I am 23/f. The only medication I am on is birth control (Gildess FE 1/20). Any help to get my vagina back to normal would be VERY much appreciated.

In April I went to the Gyno for a yellow discharge and slight fishy odor. My main doctor was not available so I saw a PA. She took a culture and told me it looked like BV. She asked if I had a new partner recently and I said yes back in March I became sexually active with a new boyfriend. This is when my problems started occurring. She didn't think it was an STD but I asked to get tested regardless. The culture came back positive for BV and the STD test came back negative for everything.

She prescribed me some tablets to take over a 2 day period that I cannot remember the name of. There was no change from taking these so she prescribed metro gel to use every night for 5 nights. This helped a bit, but I got a yeast infection as is common after using this. So she prescribed 2 fluconazole tablets to take over 2 days to get rid of the yeast infection. The yeast infection went away but just a few days later the yellow discharge returned.

I went in the office again and saw my regular doctor. She took another culture (came back P for BV) and prescribed me metro gel for 10 days and went ahead and gave me the fluconazole tablets for the yeast infection that would occur after. A few days after finishing this the yellow discharge returned. (Those few days it was gone was absolute heaven)

I emailed the doctor and she prescribed 500mg Metro tablets to take every 12 hours for 7 days. I am on the last day of this and the discharge has been constant throughout. So I know I will have to go back in.

Is there any hope?!?



Other things I have done to try to get rid of this...
*I have changed all panties to 100% cotton
*I changed soap to Dove
*I have made sure I am washing properly (just washing the lips)
*I stopped taking as many baths (I shower typically 2X a day)
*Started drinking more water
*Started eating a cleaner diet and lost some weight
*Started taking vitamins (D, B, C, some days I will only take a multi)
*I started eating yogurt every morning
*I started taking a probiotic
*I tried taking Pro-B probiotic for vaginal health but saw no change and it's expensive so I didn't buy another bottle.
*I've started exercising more (I'm not as good about this one)
*I make sure my partner and I are clean before we have intercourse which has of course been rare since this started. (We don't use condoms as I am on BC he also pulls out as to not disrupt my ph)


I am very scared this isn't going to go away. **I feel absolutely disgusting!** Should I get tested for STD's again? They seem to only be prescribing the one drug. Is this the only one available for this problem? Are there any other steps I can take for vaginal health? I hope I'm not forgetting anything.

Thank you in advance!

I'm posting this for a second time because the first didn't show up even after 2 hours. ","From my OB/Gyn rotation I learned that the vagina is a very precarious environment and anything that may skew it in one direction will cause an overgrowth of a different organism. A lot of the things you listed are good things to try to get the environment of your vagina stabilized, but I'm more curious as to what caused it in the first place. From my understanding it was the new BF correct? My BIGGEST question to you is has he been treated with the metronidazole also? Your partner MUST be treated in cases of BV as he may be an asymptomatic carrier. You can keep treating yourself with the metro (and it seems to work as you have had periods of clarity), but it will keep coming back. Metronidazole and clindamycin are the two drugs most commonly used for BV, so your doctor is right on track. If he has not been treated yet, please start there. Keep us updated on your progress and goodluck."
18,neck pain after wake boarding...webmd said cancer :(,"I went wake boarding yesterday night and woke up with my abdomen (6/10), shoulders (4/10), and neck sore (3/10). I figured I was just sore, popped 3 Advil and went about my day. As the day progressed, my neck got more sore.

At 26 hours I was eating chips and went to pore the bag with my head back. Leaning my head back, I went from a 6/10 to a 8.5/10 with a 5/10 headache. I have iced it for 20 minutes now and it has subsided to a 7/10. 

TL; DR - Went wakeboarding, landed on head, neck hurts day after.
Should I freak out?","Did you lose consciousness at all?

24,Ease my worries please,"My husband is about to see a hematologist and googling around has me worried that he's got something serious, like aplastic anemia. I know we'll find out soon enough, but in the meantime, could you please suggest alternative diagnoses that aren't so scary, so I can think positively? 

He is 50 years old, fit as an ox (bike commutes daily), eats healthy, has taken a multivitamin and a baby aspirin daily for decades, is on no other meds, and is in otherwise excellent health -- except for chronic, unexplained anemia. He has had the anemia for at least a decade.  About 5 years ago, his GP sent him for endoscopy to rule out internal bleeding. Then she put him on a course of B12 injections, that did nothing. However a few months later, his anemia then improved enough that there was no further follow up and he was okay. This year he went back for a routine check up and his anemia is back, and worse than ever. He had another endoscopy and a colonscopy. His GI tract is normal, no gluten intolerance, nothing. His B12 and folate is also normal, and his GP no longer thinks it's related to diet/B12 deficiency. She has referred him to a hematologist. She has run a ton of blood tests, everything is normal, except for his hemoglobin, which is below normal. She is also concerned with his low total blood count. His WBC and platelets are within normal range - but at the very end of low. 

Symptoms - he has all the symptoms of anemia you'd expect. Extreme fatigue, weakness, dizziness, fainting spells, sometimes short of breath, pallor, etc. He has a long history of unexplained, massive bruising (like, covering both his thighs, or his mid-torso). This comes and goes and he's never had a blood test or seen his GP during a bruising episode, but he has reported this to his doctor. On and off history of bleeding gums. And this week he admitted to me that his long bones ache. 

He showed me his blood tests so I did see the scores,  but he then took the paperwork away from me and filed them at work. I have asked for a copy and he won't give me one,  because he knows I am prone to worry too much. He tends to worry too, and I know he is much more worried than he is letting on to me.

25,"Severe shoulder, neck and back pain after tetanus vaccination","A little less than a week ago I received my tetanus booster shot (the one you receive every decade, at least here in Australia).

A few days later I began experiencing pain around my shoulder blade. This has been progressively getting worse, culminating this evening in a stiff neck and severe pain on my upper left back. It got to the point tonight where I could not move from a lying down position without my wife's assistance, and even then, the pain was excruciating. 

From what I've read, such a degree of pain days after the injection is unusual, but not unheard of. As it didn't click initially that my symptoms were related to the tetanus shot, I began treating it like a sports injury and have tried rest and ice. The ice tonight is what made it so bad. I have, therefore hit the pain killers and heat treatment. 

How long can I expect this to last? Is there anything else I can do to hasten recovery and relieve pain? 

Thanks in advance. ","I seriously don't think your pain derives from the vaccination.

Any idea what these are? The one on my cheek started off as a small scab (maybe a zit or something). I definitely scratched it inadvertently at least once. Since then, it has gotten a bit bigger. It doesn't quite scab over as you can sort of see. The skin feels tight around it. 

The marks on my jaw (you can sort of see it in all of them, but ""three"" focuses on it – albeit, a bit washed out from the light) are similar to the one on my cheek. Some dead skin/sort-of-a-scab flaked off today leaving some fresh-pink skin.

The facial hair is sort of a new thing, so I thought they might be caused by some irritation/ingrown hairs, but that doesn't seem quite right from my previous experiences. I also have about two marks (similar to the stuff on my jaw I suppose) that might be related or simply caused by the irritation of my beard. 

Any help would be seriously appreciated. ","The ones in the beard look like Tinea, a fungal infection.

31,"Why is my poo so dark, sticky and smelly? I currently on a strict paleo diet","It's weird. Before I went on a diet free of processed, frozen, junk, sugary foods, my poop was okay. You heard of people saying orange-brown is best poo colour? They're right and thats what I've had. BEFORE I changed to a new diet. Heres my current of what I eat on a typical day:

**BREAKFAST**

- Raw Vegetable greens 

- Cucumbers

- Celery

- Carrots

- Tomato

- Passionfruit

- ""Pastries"" made of almond meal or coconut flour (NO GLUTEN OR WHEAT AT ALL)

**LUNCH**

- Banana

- Carrot

- Blueberries/Raspberries

- Bread made of almond meal or coconut flour (NO GLUTEN OR WHEAT AT ALL)

- Almonds

- Cucumbers

**DINNER**

- Broccoli (steamed)

- Cauliflower (steamed)

- Fish

- Vegetable greens such as kale

I exercise by running and lifting weights on alternate days. And yet my poop is still sticky, dark green/brown in colour and very smelly.

","I actually have lactose intolerance myself, so I don't eat diary. But if you don't have lactose intolerance diary is fine. If you do, avoid it. Simple as that. I never said someone with lactose intolerance should eat diary.

32,Stomach pains after taking cold medicine?,"I've been sick for over a week, taking day/nyquil 4 times a day every day. 2 days ago, i started taking muciniex(sp?) and it finally cleared up. Well now today, well it started last night kind of, my stomach has been killing me. Not like i have to shit or vomit, just waves of mild to sometimes intense pain. I had a dream last night (i know, it sounds dumb) and while dreaming, i was having the pains in my dream and they were intense/noticable, and then when i woke up they were unberable. I thought it was just from hunger, so i got up and ate and they didn't go away. Later in the day i made myself throw up because i thought maybe i would feel better, but the pains are still there. I'm just worried that maybe the medicine messed me up somehow? Idk, but should i see a doctor or should i not really worry too much. Im not sure if i have health insurence (im 17) so i don't really want to worry my parents if it's nothing important. Any advice is welcome. ","Unfortunately this is very hard to answer from the internet with this information. Would need a lot more info on what kind of sick you were for a week, where your pain is located, how it changes with position, becomes worse if you press your abdomen, if you have nausea, how exactly the ""waves of pain"" are and so on. 

I'd say that in general, most abdominal pain is benign, nothing is wrong and you don't need to see a doctor. However if the pain is severe, doesn't go away in a couple of hours or more or is located in specific places like your upper right side you might need to see a doctor. 

It's pretty unlikely that the medicines you took have caused something wrong, but I know one of the side effects of Mucinex is kidney stones, which is one of many possible explainations for your pain. 

I guess you have to use your own instincts here. If your pain is severe and not going away on its own it might be time to see a doctor."
33,"Stomach upset, anxiety, sleep cycle screwy: What's wrong with me?!","Warning, long post. There's a tl;dr at the end, but you'd be missing a lot of background! :P  Also, I know the whole ""Reddit is not a substitute for professional medical advice"", I'm just trying to see if anyone has experienced anything similar / has any advice.  I'm not the kind of person who really ever goes to the doctor, and if a lifestyle change could help me I'd much rather do that first than spend thousands of dollars to have a doctor tell me the same thing.  However, this has been going on for over a year now and is impacting my life, and I want to do something about it if possible.

Quick about me: Male, 26, 6ft 145lb.

Current complaint:

Basically the biggest issue is that my stomach seems rather overly sensitive.  Every morning it feels uncomfortable / bloated, whether I force myself to eat something or not.  This often persists through the afternoon, and on occasion the entire day.  The discomfort is not so much pain as it is pressure, mild nausea, and bloating / the need to burp.  Sometimes antacids help a little, although that may just be placebo, and forcing myself to burp can help too. BM's range from 3 to 6 on the Bristol scale, varying on a near daily basis, and with the sense that things are not spending more than 12-24 hours in the GI system.  

This issue causes my second complaint, or is perhaps caused by, or perhaps they feed each other, which is kind of anxiety.  That is, when my stomach is upset, it makes me worry about it, which probably makes it more upset.  I'll start worrying that this time my stomach is going to be a little more upset than normal and I'll vomit, or that people will notice my discomfort, or... well, it's hard to describe because I know it's not really a logical feeling, but suffice to say my upset stomach can make me feel quite anxious especially when I'm around other people.

A third thing that may factor in to this situation is my sleep cycle.  I am currently trying to get a good amount of sleep, usually going to bed between 11 and 12, and waking up usually around 9am. Despite this, when I wake up I still feel incredibly tired (though not always sleepy, sometimes I wake up naturally but still feel groggy and tired).  I really can't get going sometimes until 10am, and I'm usually still a bit out of it (and worrying about my upset stomach) for the rest of the morning.


Background:

As for the stomach issue, I don't know where this is coming from. Growing up I was never particularly food sensitive (though I did tend to be a picky eater).  I believe I am mildly lactose intolerant, although I never ate very many milk products anyway -- don't like cheese or yogurt or drinking milk, that pretty much leaves ice cream, and these days I take lactaid with ice cream.  Last year I discovered that I'm apparently allergic to bananas; I had started eating bananas in 2012 and would have them as snacks, but at the same time my digestive health was going downhill, painful upset stomachs and occasionally bloody stool. Took me some time to make the connection, but I eventually realized that my stomach always became upset 15-20 minutes after eating a banana.  Stopped eating them and improved immediately.  However, I guess I'd say I never went quite back to normal, because since them I've been experiencing the symptoms described above.

I'd also classify myself as eating generally decently, I eat out some and cook for myself some, eat a mix of fruits, vegetables, meats, and pastathings, drink probably 80oz of water a day and a little fruit juice, not too into sweet foods / drinks, rarely ever drink alcohol or anything with caffeine. I'm underweight if anything.

For the anxiety, well, I'm not entirely surprised at myself. I've always been extraordinarily shy / had social anxiety issues.  Any time I'm entering a new situation or one where I'm not in control, I'm likely to feel some anxiety.  In my younger years I believe I suffered from depression; though it was never diagnosed or treated, I was really pessimistic about life and occasionally mildly suicidal. In the past 5-6 years, my mental state has dramatically improved with respect to the depression, and I've gained some confidence, but I'm still likely to be very anxious and/or awkward in social situations.  I suppose in my current situation, it's the fact that I can't control my stomach upset, and it might be noticed by others, and it might be potentially embarrassing, that causes my anxiety. Alternately, I'm experiencing stress / generalized anxiety which manifests as an overly sensitive stomach -- this is something I am not really certain about, is the anxiety an amplifying factor in a physical stomach condition, or is an upset stomach a psychosomatic response to a mental condition?

As for my sleep cycle, I've always been a ""night owl"" and have always functioned better at night. That said, in high school and before I had to get up early, and was able to do so without these issues. Throughout college, I also kept a generally earlier schedule.  It's only been the past couple years that I've just been unable to function well in the morning (oh, and if I force myself to get up earlier, my stomach will be even more upset throughout the day).  It doesn't matter if I go to bed at 9pm or at midnight, I still can't function in the morning (and I'll sometimes still take a nap for an hour or two in the late afternoon).  I'd almost describe myself as delayed-phase sleep disorder, because sometimes when I decide to stay up late working, I'll feel best and get the most done from like 11pm to 3-4am.  



So, Reddit, what do you think?  Do I have some physical issue causing my digestive upset, and if so is it some chronic lifelong thing, or something that could be treated / mitigated?  Or do I have some mental issue that's manifesting itself as sleep cycle problems and upset stomach?  Or do I have a sleep disorder that's causing stomach and mood disturbances? or do I have a bad case of intestinal gnomes?

tl;dr:  Suffering from chronic upset stomach (lack of appetite, nausea, bloating and discomfort); anxiety; and delayed sleep cycle / inability to function in the morning.  All three seem to be related, but I'm not sure what the core issue is nor what to do about it.  However, this has been going on for a while and is negatively impacting my quality of life, so I want to figure something out.","What you are describing here is basically a textbook case of mild irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and a mild social anxiety disorder combined. IBS is a functional bowel disorder strongly associated with anxiety and other psychosocial factors. Patients with IBS also have increased motility of their GI-tract (which you are describing) and often increased sensitivity to distention of their GI-tract. About 20% of the general population fulfill criteria for IBS, so it's very common. 

So the question is, what can be done to help you? Sometimes it can be helpful to eliminate/reduce certain things from your diet. About 20% will have some relief of symptoms by eliminating lactose (which you already did) and wheat from their diets. Also reducing caffeine (which can also increase anxiety, but you rarely use it it seems) and artificial sweeteners can help. 

As for the anxiety, there are many options. Being shy and feeling social anxiety in new situations is extremely common - so common that we may call it normal. You can always take some measures yourself to help your anxiety - like exposing yourself to new situations more often and going out to meet people more often. I know this can be very difficult, because it's unpleasant, but it will help in the long run. For example, when you have a choice between going out and staying home, try to always chose the option of going out. Just know that social anxiety is very normal, and everyone feels some anxiety in new situations where they dont have control. As long as you're able to live with it and go on with your daily activites it doesn't necessarily have to be a big problem. 

However if your anxiety comes to the point where you are isolating yourself or unable to go on with your normal life, I'd recommend seeing a psychologist. The best treatment right now is cognitive behavioral therapy, which is generally very effective. There are also drug treatments with SSRI's (anti-depressants) and specifically for anxiety and IBS, amitripyline. 

I think your sleep cycle-issues are also related to your anxiety, but might also be symptoms of depression. 

If you have any questions or something is unclear, feel free to ask and I'll try my best to answer."
34,Can a Doctor Fix My Anal Region???,"I was experimenting with masturbation and I tried to stimulate the prostate glad. I got really rough and literally rubbed skin off right around the anus. There was alittle skin that actually came of and it left a little scratch indent that expands and contracts under the anus. At some angles you can not see it but at others it looks like another hole under the anus. It hasn't gone away in a year so I think it is permanently scared like that. It doesnt hurt but I don't want a torn looking anus. Is there anyway they can fix this problem? Where would I go? Could a regular doctor do it???

35,Just how dangerous is it to drink a lot of energy drinks?,"For the past 6 years I have been drinking 1 liters of Euro Shopper energy drink every single day. I am addicted but I don't want to stop because it's cheap and I like it. I am not overweight at all, and I exercise regularly. Is it still dangerous?","If the source from wikipedia is correct, 1 liter of Euro Shopper contain about 320mg of caffeine, which is equivalent to 3-5 cups of coffee. I can't imagine that this will be dangerous. Some times energy drinks contain other stimulants, such as ginseng and guarana, which may potentiate the effect of coffeine or in the case of guarana, contain coffeine themself. Therefore it can be difficult to know exactly how much caffeine and how potent an energy drink is, but I still don't think it's particularly dangerous. A bigger concern is the amount of sugar in it, but I guess you are aware of that.

Possible side effects are insomnia, anxiety, irritability, diarrhea, increased blood pressure, heart palptations and very rarely heart arrhythmias."
36,[Meta] Race?,What exactly do you mean with race? I guess this is a subreddit for humans only?,"It's generally assumed that when you are typing on reddit you are in fact a human or a very intelligent monkey (which are physiologically similar, so we don't really care either way). So what we are interested in is; are you caucasian, african american, asian, etc.

The reason this can be important is that prevalence of certain diseases are different among different races. An extreme example is Tay-Sachs Disease. Tay-Sachs Disease is very rare, except in Azkenazi-Jews where the carrier rate of the affected gene is about 1/25. Sometimes treatment can be different for different races too. For example, there is some evidence to say that african americans benefit more from diuretics or calcium channel blockers for hypertension, rather than other drugs. "
37,Is this reflux or something else?,"Sorry for my bad english, I'm not a native speaker.

When under mental (job interview, school exam) or physical stress (running, demanding workout) I start to retch and have to stop what I am doing and kneel down, shut my eyes and stay immobile to control my breath for 5-15 seconds while it passes away. I never wommit, but feel like I will any second.

It all started when I was in elementary school and realized that sit-ups make me nauseaus. I had no other sympthoms back than right until first year of university where the stress levels were much higher. There 10-30 minutes before exams I started the retching part.

At the age of 30 I gained a lot of weight, I was about 104kg and 185cm tall. I did martial arts, but the above described sympthoms appeart. It was so bad that just sitting in my car seemed to compress my stomach and lungs and I started retching.

At 32 I lost almost 20kgs and all sympthoms wanished. Now I'm back at about 95 and the sympthoms are worse than ever, especially because I had a knee injury last autumn and my conditioning is pretty bad right now.

The problem now is that I also seem to have decreased lung capacity. When I'm out of breath, the retching starts immedietly. I never smoked or drinked alcohol ever and still try my best during trainings, but my condition doesn't improve much.

During wrestling when my upper body is compressed, I immedietly start to panic beacause I'm out of breath. Never had this problem before.

Eating a lot and sugary drinks (especially energy drinks) make the sympthoms appear for sure, don't even have to stress or move a lot.

This could be just reflux or hiatus hernia, but I don't get the usual reflux sympthoms (no heartburn, no pain, no acid taste... maybe the cough part, but I'm not sure).

Is this reflux or something else?",Sounds like it's more probable that this is related to anxiety rather than an organic disease like reflux. Your symptoms are very much like mild panic attacks. 
38,Daughter running high fevers and very agitated,"My four year old daughter is running high fevers 102-104 for a couple of days and has vomited twice 24 hours apart and is very agitated. We took her to the pediatrician and she said her lungs sounded okay and her ears were totally fine. She said that her throat was red and ordered a flu and strep swab. Both of those were negative so she said she believes that it is an upper respiratory infection and to wait a week and come back if she is not better, offering nothing more than Tylenol. My daughter has been sick many times but this time just feels different than the previous times that my daughter has been sick because she is very agitated and can't sleep more than 10 minutes without waking up. Normally when she gets sick she will be very drowsy and knocked out. I can draw on my own personal experiences that when I get sick and I cannot sleep and I am super agitated as opposed to drowsy it has always been a bacterial infection. I am upset that the doctor didn't order a blood test to determine if it is bacterial or viral. I don't want my daughter to suffer a week and risk complications if it is bacterial because the doctor didn't order a simple blood test. ","If it is a bacterial upper respiratory tract infection, antibiotics are mainly helpful against symptoms (reducing them by a couple of days), and the only complication it prevents is quinsy (peritonsillar abscess), which can be treated very easily. Antibiotics don't prevent otitis media, and in the western world the rate of preventing rheumatic fever is so low that it's absolutetly not worth it. Even for confirmed streptococcal infection it's very debatable if antibiotics are beneficial if you compare side effects with benefits. URTI go away on their own, even if they are bacterial, with or without antibiotics, usually in 3-10 days. 

There isn't really a blood test to determine if you have a bacterial or viral infection unfortunately. Sometimes we use CRP, and there is some evidence to say that if the CRP is &gt;40, it's quite likely to be a bacterial infection, but it isn't a very good or specific test. 

However I haven't seen your daughter and I haven't examined her myself, so I can't really say anything more than that. If you are concerned, take her to another pediatrician or family doctor and get a second opinion. Parents intuition that something is wrong and out of the ordinary is always a concern, at least for me. 

Tylenol is fine and will help with the pain, but NSAIDS and 3x 20mg prednisolone are significantly more effective and both are proven to reduce symptoms in URTI (and they are safe)."
39,So.... should I do call ahead seating for a liver transplant or...?,"I've been reading about tylenol being dangerous if more than 4000mg is taken in a day and now I really need to know if I'm killing my liver. I have a ton of surgical rods and screws in my back from scoliosis correction and also have severe fibromyalgia. To help relieve pain I take tramadol, cymbalta, and of course tylenol. 

I take 3900 mg of tylenol pretty much every day, sometimes more if I need to take a 3rd dose. I generally take 3 650mg tablets first thing in the morning and again late in the afternoon or at bedtime. Sometimes I wind up taking 3 doses in a day when I'm busy going all day or if I'm having a really painful day which would bring me up to a total of 5850mg in 24 hrs. 

I know I should probably take less but this is what I've had to do to function somewhat normally, and honestly I barely get by. 

So.... call ahead seating for a liver transplant?","You need to increase the dose of tramadol or do something else about this pain instead of using that much Tylenol. I actually don't think it is a huge deal if you take a little more than 4000mg occasionally, but it certainly isn't recommended. "
40,"21 y/o, early repolarization, chest discomfort","21 y/o male, have had chest pain since age 14 or 15... it happens randomly.

I went to my family doc and told him I have chest pain so he did a EKG, he came up with early repolarization and said it was nothing to worry about. I still have the chest pain and I'm a little worried about doing physical exercise. So when my doc says I shouldn't worry about it, should I just ignore it, or what? Should I see a cardiologist?","I think your chest pain is very very unlikely to be related to your heart. I'd look into other causes like gastrointestinal, muskuloskeletal or psychiatric.

41,I have a high resting heart rate.,"I have a high resting heart rate. I'm not sure how long my heart rate has been this fast, but I know its been like this for a good two or three months when I first started checking it. My heart rate is usually 90 bpm during the day. In the evenings it usually drops to 70-78 bpm. I haven't been experiencing serious issues like shortness of breath or light headedness, so I'm trying to narrow it down before making a doctors appointment about it.

A bit of information that may help:
* I do not smoke or drink. 
* I don't necessarily exercise, but doing exercise is not much of an issue.
* I'm a 'slim' guy with high metabolism, weight is not a concern.
* My daily nutrition is not the best however, it's a stereotypical college students meal plan... mix of cereal, frozen dinners, and fast food. I sort of slack on fruits and vegetables.
* I do drink coffee around noon, but my heart rate is still high before I drink it.
* I've been told my blood pressure is fine as of a month ago, but I plan to re check it to make sure.

My biggest concern is could this be a result of a health issue? Something I should seek medical attention for? Any important nutrients I could be lacking that could be a result of this? Is there any supplements I could try?","You heart rate is normal. Your resting heart rate will go down if you exercise. Stress/anxiety might also be a factor.

46,A few symptoms... not sure if anything serious.,"Age: 25
Sex: Male
Height: 6' 0""
Weight: 147

It's worth noting that although I'm not overweight, I have an abnormal lifestyle. I'm extremely sedentary (I sit for probably at least 12 hours on a normal day and almost never exercise), and I have a pretty poor diet. I eat fruit and vegetables, but I also eat too much food with high fat-content (pizza) and sugar (like fruit juices and cookies).
Over the last couple weeks, I've noticed a few things that are concerning to me. I've had at least a couple instances of what I think are described as heart palpitations. I wasn't able to get any sleep last night after a palpitation. 
A few times recently, when I laid down to go to sleep at night, I heard my pulse/heartbeat in my ear. And on a few mornings, I woke up with slightly cramped calves. I've also woken up with my arm completely ""asleep"". And when I shovel snow outside, my hands go numb within 20 minutes, even though I wear fairly well-insulated winter gloves. This may not be related, but I've also noticed that my ears seem to ""pop"" a bit when I swallow. I don't remember that happening until recently. 

I'm worried that I might already have some sort of cardiovascular issue, whether it's atherosclerosis or something else of that nature. Maybe I'm just paranoid. Or it could be that I'm not paranoid, and someone else in my shoes would go to an ER immediately. I don't really know what to think, and I don't want to insist on getting a bunch of tests done if nothing is wrong. I don't always fully trust my own perception on these things, to be honest. Anyway, does it make sense to see a doctor about my concerns?
","1) Hearing/feeling your own pulse is normal. As long as it's not very fast (lets say about 100 bpm or more) or irregular I wouldn't worry too much about it.


2) Slightly cramped calves can be explained by many things. Maybe you did something the day before that your calves weren't so used too? Maybe you slept in an awkward position? Maybe they just felt that way because you focused on it, but perhaps they just were a little sore or nothing was wrong?


3) I don't know exactly what you mean by ""go numb"". Did you lose all sensation? Just some pricking? It can also be completely normal to lose a bit of sensation or feel some pricking of the skin if you're out in the cold and doing work, especially if you are a little out of shape.


4) It's probably not your ears popping, but your temporomandibular joint (TMJ) popping. This is also normal.


5) Well, we all have a little atherosclerosis. It starts from when we're young and progresses gradually. How fast it progresses and if we're ever going to have a cardiovascular event like a heart attack, stroke, aneurysm or something is up to genetics, lifestyle and some other factors. You're young, so even though your lifestyle isn't the healthiest, it's very unlikely that you have for example peripheral arterial disease that's causing numbness in your hands.


6) So does it make sense to see doctor because of this? Yes and no. There is no way I can give you a good answer to that just from the internet. I haven't examined you and done a proper history, I'm just writing my opinion and suggestions to what your symptoms might be related to. Personally I don't think any of your symptoms are very worrisome. However, if you feel like you need to see a doctor, go see a doctor. "

49,Extreme diarrhea and vomiting three weeks after stopping antibiotics for sinus infection.,"I just can't win. I went to urgent care and was prescribed antibiotics for a sinus infection. Easy. While I was taking them, I became very irregular, but that's a common side effect of antibiotics, so oh well.  
Two weeks later I still haven't taken a solid shit (literally) since my infection. I dismiss it as more recuperating.  
Week three starts tomorrow. It's 4:40 a.m. where I am. I'm heaving because I can't vomit any more. I'm defecating pure liquid. I don't know what to do, it's getting nothing but worse, I hardly was able to pay for the first doctor's visit, and tomorrow's Sunday.  
Any advice to just help me feel better? My father said to sip soda. I'll need to eat sometime. What should I be eating? How often? Is this something more serious than I'm making it out to be, or will the doctor just tell me to go home and wait it out at a $85 charge?","Drink enough water so you don't get dehydrated. Try to eat something, maybe start with small portions of soup or something that's easy to digest. Eat as much and drink as much as you can, it doesn't make the diarrhea worse or better. 

You need to be tested for Clostridium Difficile. That would be the first thing on the differential for diarrhea weeks after antibiotic use. "
50,Tonsil Problems,"Sore throat developed 02/12/2014. Initially was one-sided, suspecting it to be gland pain because I felt it in my neck. Two days after, lots of exudate in both tonsils - had to drain it off just to swallow somewhat comfortably. Today, Im at the point I can barely swallow again. Cant see exudate superficially, but I can ""inside"" if that makes sense. Also developed abscess-looking lesions next to my tonsils, albeit small. No fever... yet anyways. 

I definitely plan on seeking professional help for this, but Im wondering if I should wait till the clinic opens on Tuesday, go to the ED, or maybe even go out of town to see if a walk-in clinic is open in the morning?

20 y/o F, wisdom teeth removed one month ago, no current meds but had penicillin VK and percocet for the surgery. Have had about 10 or so similar episodes within the past 6 months. Some of these tested positive for strep (medicated accordingly) while others did not. I asked about seeing an ENT, but clinic said that was a little over the top. Havent sought treatment for about half of these because the practitioners make it seem like its not worth the time. What do I need to ask or say to get the most out of my appointment?","Sounds like you might have a peritonsillar abcess. You can probably wait until thuesday, but you have to be careful and watch the size of it, because if it grows very big you could be looking at a risk for airway obstruction. Usually they don't increase in size extremely fast so it should be ok waiting til thuesday.

Anyway, a peritonsillar abcess (if that's what you have) needs to be drained. If you've had about 10 episodes of tonsillitis in the past 6 months you definitely need to see an ENT and be considered for tonsillectomy."
51,Is it possible to have a tumor diagnosis of T4 N0?,"My family member had a type of biliary cancer. After surgery and a visit with the oncologist we were given the final result: T3 N0 M0. However now fluid has been found in the layer outside lung and there is a possibility it could be cancer, but if ALL of the nodes came back negative is it still possible?? ","I'm not sure I understand your question or you have two questions. Yes, it's possible to have a T4 N0 tumor. T = size or local invasion of the tumor. N = nodal spread. And yes, it's unfortunately also possible that the fluid outside the lung is related to the cancer even though all nodes found were negative. Everything can happen with cancer. Sometimes the cells spread directly via blood before nodes are involved. Sometimes they spread to nodes that aren't sampled during the surgery. Sometimes the pathologist makes a mistake or the cancer invasion of the nodes were very small. Sometimes it spreads so quickly after that even though the nodes were negative at the time of the surgery it could have spread after that. Cancer can be very unpredictable sometimes unfortunately. "

He has it elevated and had ice on it before. ","I doesn't look obviously fractured from those pictures, but there's no way it can be ruled out with that. Maybe you could take one or two pictures where we can see both ankles from the front so it's easier to compare. 

The only thing that would tell you for certain that there's a fracture is if there's a displacement or bone is sticking out of the skin. If you're concerned about a fracture, tell your brother to see a doctor. You can wait it out a couple of days until the swelling goes down."

56,Heart failure?,"It's probably unlikely that I have heart failure (18 y/o), but I think I'm feeling short of breath when on my bed (actually it feels like more like a tight or heavy sensation in my throat/upper chest and kinda like I need to cough). I've felt this for 4 days now and it's worse at night. I have pretty bad anxiety over my heart and I'm constantly worrying about it.

Doing some tests at home my BP was measured at 122/80 and capillary refill is under 1 second when pressing on my toe nail. Resting heart rate is 55-70 BPM and there's usually no irregularities with the beat, but it does speed up/down sometimes weirdly and I get palpitations on occasion.

Looking online, these results seem to be pretty much perfect. But is it possible that some people with heart failure can get good results like mine, or would they get far worse results?",It's extremely unlikely that you have heart failure. You don't just develop heart failure over a few days unless you would have something rare like myocarditis. Your symptoms are probably related to anxiety. Talk about it with your family doctor or a psychologist.

My throat is increasingly sore, and when I use a light to see in my throat, my whole throat is red.  There is no telltale whiteness anywhere, but the back of my throat isn't smooth either - it has relatively pale raised areas arranged in superior-inferior- running lines especially down each side of my throat.  The pain is localized to naso- and oro-pharynx.  My voice is not suffering, but swallowing really hurts.  I just want to be able to rule out bacterial infection so I don't waste time at the doctor. Can you guys help?

I'm on tylenol for pain, and no other meds.  Female, 30s, normal weight.

Thanks for any advice.","There are some clinical findings that can suggest if it's caused by bacteria or virus, but they're not very helpful in practice. Those are 


1) Runny nose - more likely to be viral


2) Hoarse voice or dry caugh - more likely to be viral


3) Visible exudates/pus on tonsils - more likely to be bacterial


4) Fever - more likely to be bacterial


5) Swollen and tender lymph nodes in the neck - more likely to be bacterial


That being said, it doesn't really matter if it's bacterial or viral, because antibiotics for bacterial pharyngitis only helps by reducing symptoms for a couple of days anyway. Tylenol/an NSAID does the same and avoids the side effects from the antibiotic. In my opinion, you wouldn't necessarily need to see a doctor even if you could say for sure it was a bacterial infection."

Location Australia","Well, you're talking about diarrhea, which is unpleasant, but not really a big problem. However, penicillin has other side effects, some quite serious. For example, the incidence of anaphylactic shock after penicillin is 10-50 per 100.000. The incidence of death from anaphylactic shock is 1-2/100.000. The NNT for preventing one rheumatic fever in a developed country is 200.000 (because antibiotics are approximately 50% effective for preventing rheumatic fever). This means that for each rheumatic fever we prevent, we will cause 2 deaths from anaphylactic shock and 20-100 anaphylactic reactions. The incidence of C. diff from penicillin is unknown, but certainly much higher than 1/100.000. Do you still think it's worth it to take penicillin for strep throat? It's gonna be a hard argument to make if you live in a developed country.

""In non-Indigenous Australians, the decision to treat GAS pharyngitis with antibiotics should not at present be based on prevention of acute rheumatic fever."""

64,Bad reaction to bp meds,"30 f have been on atenolol 25 mg for bp since i was 20. Was put on lisinopril for a short time, but had to come off of it due to getting heart palpitations.

Ive been on that for a few days and yesterday my bp spiked to 133/98 and pulse at 100. I felt like i was going to pass out, shaky, and headache. I call my doctor and was told to either wait it out or go back on my atenolol.  The whole reason to go off of the atenolol was because it is a betta blocker and not the best thing to be on when pregnant.  This morning bp at 130/102 and pulse 83. 

I did try and go off bp meds over the summer with doctors care and had a similar reaction. Racing pulse and bp.  Just not sure if there is something else to try.  Not so happy with my  docs response. Any advice is greatly appreciated. :-)","Both labetalol and atenolol are beta-blockers, it's just that labetalol is the only beta-blocker that is safe to take during pregnancy.

130/102-133/98 and a pulse of 83-100 aren't bad numbers. But if you're feeling bad that's obviously a concern. You should talk to your doctor about either slightly increasing the dose of labetalol or changing to another antihypertensive that can be used during pregnancy (there are other options)."

So it started off on my arm, and i thought it was ringworm. I do highschool wrestling so it's not uncommon to obtain ringworm. I went to the doctors on friday, and he said it was empetigo which i still wasn't too worried about. He prescribed cephalexin 500mg 2 capsule's 2 times a day. And it made my empetigo on my arm start to go away a little/shrink. On thursday friday i noticed a few bumps on my forhead but i thought they were pimples. On saturday and into sunday it got a lot worse. Also on saturday i noticed my lymph nodes enlarged a little. On monday i went to the doctor and he took a culture sample (I think that's what it's called) and prescribed doxycycline hyclate 1 capsule 100mg twice a day in addition to the cephalexin. I had terrible headaches saturday-tuesday. They really lightened up today though which is great. The doctor said since i've been on the new antibiotic for less than 48 hours it's good that it hasn't spread and it's now not contagious. The culture sample should be in tomorrow to see if there's another antibiotic that will work better. Anyways, I normally wouldn't flip out about this but i have a state tournament on friday afternoon-saturday for wrestling and if i can't wrestle i'll be extremely crushed. It was great news that it's not contagious because i wouldn't want to give this to anyone else through spreading it on the wrestling mats/skin contact. But the other coaches might question it so i can always get a doctors note that says it's not contagious but even if i do, they might throw me out of the tournament because ""it looks bad"". So please reddit, i ask for some advice on what to do. How can i make it look not as bad? I heard it's bad to pop the blister like things filled with fluid, so i haven't been. I also heard it might help to apply warm to it to help it drain or something? Some of it's dried up like a scab. Is there any type of cream that would lighten it up?

in the meantime, though, i have neuropathy in my feet.  it can get pretty bad, tingling like my feet are asleep at the best of times; outright pain at the worst.  during the day, it's generally not so bad that i can't get by, but at night, when i'm in bed trying to go to sleep, it gets bad.  i often can't fall asleep until my exhaustion overpowers the pain in my feet.

is there anything *else* i can be doing?  right now i basically just wear really soft socks pretty much 24/7, along with well-fitting shoes.  nothing else seems to help.","First, there's no ""pre-diabetes"". Modern concepts indicate that cases like yours already have target-organ damage, as you show with the neuropathy. But also, the concept that diabetes is a one way road to hell is false, you can overcome it with metabolic and therapeutic discipline.
Second, the neuropathy will only truly improve with long term control of your glycemic status and metabolic (B12, for example) stability. Unfortunately, everything else is palliative until then.
Third, there are nice therapeutic options you could try, **upon talking to your doctor** (of course), like duloxetine - but they should be tried long term to reach any improvement. Another option, but only as a last resort, could be the use of a sleep inducing medication (like a diazepine, for example) just so the consequences of the neuropathy are minimized.

Remember, you are not out of options, but the only real solution is hard work and discipline to achieve metabolic control.

And while you may call yourself ""relaxed"", your words say otherwise.
Have you been sleeping worse? Do you remember your dreams? Do you wake up already tired?
Also, do you feel like crying for no reason? Are you a fearful person? How is your ""support circle"" (family and friendly relations)?

Your doc is not wrong. If you're not feeling okay, it's never ""nothing"", but it can well be something with no physiological implications. Even before you start answering this, I urge you to remember, you're asking family, friends, coworkers, doctors, and the internet for help - it's way past the time you start trusting the help that is offered to you.

74,"Random chest pain, two occurrences in past year","Medical background: Healthy, if out of shape(but not overweight) 20-year-old. Occasional alcohol use and cigar smoking(once or twice a month for both), used to smoke marijuana. Family history on my mothers side of heart disease, heart attacks in both grandparents on that side and my grandpa died of it when he was in his 50s or 60 or something, though my grandma lived to the ripe old age of 93, finally succumbing to cancer.

I'm currently in Health 101, and was reading the chapter on cardiovascular disease. The section on angina reminded me of two occurrences in chest pain over the past year, and since I have the family history of heart problems, figured I should pay attention to that more then I have been.

The first time, back in June, I was just sitting in a work training session, taking notes, and I got a pain in my chest. It was most painful when I inhaled, the more full my lungs were the more painful it was. I took shallower breaths, didn't say anything, and it went away in about ten minutes.

The second time, just a couple weeks ago, I had the same pain upon waking up. I was laying down, and getting up made it hurt more, as did taking deep breaths, so I just took shallow breaths and the pain subsided within 5 or 10 minutes.

Does any doctor know what this possibly could be? Is it a lung issue or a heart issue? And are these symptoms serious enough that I should see a doctor?","What I will say shouldn't make you avoid getting examined, but it looks like Tietze syndrome, ostheomuscular pain in the thoracic region.

Every single night around 6 or 7, after dinner, he is out cold for the rest of the night. Like, instant rem sleep within ten minutes out cold. 

Is this normal recovery? I just want to make sure it's not a symptom of something else. ","Can be, but I wouldn't promptly discard some encephalitis (maybe fungal, judging by the semi acute aspect of it) risen by the natural immune deficit of the circadian rhythm.

76,"Issues building up, fear of needles keeping me from doing anything.","Long story short, 7 years ago i came home in debilitating lower stomach pain that lasted for 3 weeks. I went from 230 to 182lbs in 4 weeks. I saw my doctor twice during the 4 week span, it worried her at the time.

5 years ago I had these red painful bumps appear on my left neck, it is still there and painful once a month. 3 years ago a pilonidal cyst appeared.

I haven't actually seen any doctor since the stint 7 years ago. The reason is my fear of needles. 

My last visit she asked for a blood sample, I went fully knowing I would pass out like every other time. However this time just before i passed out i felt an extreme pain in my chest, honestly the only way i can describe it was when my lung collapsed after falling off a hill, when i awoke i had doctors standing all around me. My heart had stopped. They were freaking out, they put me on some kind of monitor and what not. They made a note to my doctor, but i never returned.

I had to have a filling done a year after that incident, i warned them i would pass out. That same painful feeling happened, and when i came to they were on the phone with 911 and freaking out. They said they couldn't feel a pulse, on staff nurse did cpr and called 911.

I need help, and i don't know where else to go. I don't fear death, but i certainly wouldn't want another person to think they caused my passing.

This constant pain in my stomach, the cyst, and my neck are all becoming too much. It's a rotation of pain cycles every month. The cyst is large enough i would be put under to have it removed. If i can't even take a needle for freezing, how in the hell would i survive any duration with an IV.

79,How instant are the effects of cutting soda and drinking water?,"For as long as I can remember (I'm not exaggerating) I have only drank caffeine products, usually soda.  I decided to try drinking water only for a bit and see if it gives me better control of ever-growing weight.  1 day later of only drinking water and I don't feel as hungry all the time, it used to be that I'd still be hungry after a full meal now today I'm full half way through the meal.  I feel A LOT less tired and fatigued and only slept for about 8 hours where as I usually sleep for 12 or 14.  Is water really that beneficial, is it a coincidence, or is it just in my head?",That's probably a placebo effect. Water is just water. Soda is basically water with sugar. 
80,My urinary frequency has me stumped.,"So a few weeks ago, as I went off my antibiotic for acne (doxycycline), I started to gradually get more and more urinary frequency/urgency. I pretty much just always feel like I have to go.

So I went to the doctor. Urine test came up negative for UTI, which was the obvious suspicion. Then was a blood test. Blood test came up normal. I don't have diabetes.

The weird thing is that i'm not really experiencing pain. There has been once or twice when there's been *mild* burning while I urinate. There's also been once or twice when I've felt a very dull ache in my lower back, the right side. But again, this was once or twice over the course of three weeks.

There's no blood, discharge, fever, or shivers.

So I went to see a Urologist. He confirmed its not prostate related.
It's also not that my bladder isn't emptying fully.

Next week i'm going to get my kidney checked but chances are, its not that. If it was, i should be experiencing quite a bit of pain.

Anyway, in my mind I feel like i'm running out of reasonable things it could be. The only thing i can find is Interstitial Cystitis. This seems weird because I'm male, 21 years old, and I'm not experiencing bladder pain.

I just feel like my symptoms don't really align with anything.

Oh also, one of the weirdest things about it is that I feel like I had it about a year ago, too. Except it only lasted for a couple days. I remember having to pee into a cup in my room because otherwise i'd have to wake up so much during the night. But again there was no pain.

I'm wondering if I should stop taking them I have two options:
1) I stop because I have a virus and only felt better after antibiotics as a coincidence
2) I continue taking them because maybe I have some other bacteria and the antibiotics are actually working

I had someone put their hand there and they could feel it, especially when I coughed. It doesn't really hurt anymore. Is there any immediate need for me to find a doctor here and see one?

I slept pretty much all day. Anyways when I woke up this morning my throat felt like sandpaper whenever I try to drink or just swallow my spit, when I looked in the back of my throat there was white spots everywhere. So I just took another ibuprofen. But I can't eat or drink anything, the pain is so horrible. Also if it does happen to be strep what meds will I be given? Like will they be huge pills or liquids? Im horrible at taking large pills (over three fourths of an inch) lol I know in weird. But if I do get a liquid will it be a nasty tasting one? Anyways, what can I do to relieve some of the pain right now. ","There are 3 medications proven to help with symptoms from strep throat.

My Erythropoietin was 10.5 mIU/mL with the report saying the normal range is 4.2-27.8. I just found out yesterday I have severe sleep apnea which I understand can cause hypoxia which can cause high levels of Erythropoietin which can cause secondary polycythemia. So my question is, with my Erythropoietin level NOT being high, could the sleep apnea be ruled out as a cause for my polycythemia?

86,Potentially damaged stomach lining - help!,"*20y old female* regurgitated what appeared to be some form of lining. I had some food poisoning a few days ago, and since then, food has not been sitting well in my stomach. Yesterday, I was fine the whole day until after I ""ate"" dinner when I first saw the lining come up; however, I thought it may have been the skin from the blue berries I had earlier in the day, so I didn't think much of it. Tonight it happened again only it was a much much larger piece of whatever it is. It was a brownish color similar to that of stomach lining, but I am not feeling any pain or discomfort which is typical after expelling part of your lining. 

Also, I should mention that I've recently been diagnosed with acid reflux (from all the all-nighter coffees in college), and my doctor mentioned that my esophagus already had some minor damage near the esophageal sphincter. 

Aside from staying away from food for a few more days, what would your suggestions be? If I feel no pain, how crucial do you think it would be that I go see a doctor right away? I was planning on going over the weekend, but now I'm not sure I should wait that long.
