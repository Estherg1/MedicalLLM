symptoms,What are the symptoms of Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM) ?,"LCMV is most commonly recognized as causing neurological disease, as its name implies, though infection without symptoms or mild febrile illnesses are more common clinical manifestations. 
                
For infected persons who do become ill, onset of symptoms usually occurs 8-13 days after exposure to the virus as part of a biphasic febrile illness. This initial phase, which may last as long as a week, typically begins with any or all of the following symptoms: fever, malaise, lack of appetite, muscle aches, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms appearing less frequently include sore throat, cough, joint pain, chest pain, testicular pain, and parotid (salivary gland) pain. 
                
Following a few days of recovery, a second phase of illness may occur. Symptoms may consist of meningitis (fever, headache, stiff neck, etc.), encephalitis (drowsiness, confusion, sensory disturbances, and/or motor abnormalities, such as paralysis), or meningoencephalitis (inflammation of both the brain and meninges). LCMV has also been known to cause acute hydrocephalus (increased fluid on the brain), which often requires surgical shunting to relieve increased intracranial pressure. In rare instances, infection results in myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord) and presents with symptoms such as muscle weakness, paralysis, or changes in body sensation. An association between LCMV infection and myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscles) has been suggested. 
                
Previous observations show that most patients who develop aseptic meningitis or encephalitis due to LCMV survive. No chronic infection has been described in humans, and after the acute phase of illness, the virus is cleared from the body. However, as in all infections of the central nervous system, particularly encephalitis, temporary or permanent neurological damage is possible. Nerve deafness and arthritis have been reported. 
                
Women who become infected with LCMV during pregnancy may pass the infection on to the fetus. Infections occurring during the first trimester may result in fetal death and pregnancy termination, while in the second and third trimesters, birth defects can develop. Infants infected In utero can have many serious and permanent birth defects, including vision problems, mental retardation, and hydrocephaly (water on the brain). Pregnant women may recall a flu-like illness during pregnancy, or may not recall any illness. 
                
LCM is usually not fatal. In general, mortality is less than 1%.","Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) is a viral infection caused by the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which is primarily transmitted to humans through exposure to infected rodents, especially common house mice. The illness typically presents in two phases. The first phase often begins one to two weeks after exposure and includes symptoms that resemble a flu-like illness, such as fever, lack of appetite, malaise, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, chest pain, and sometimes pain in the testicles or salivary glands. This initial stage may resolve temporarily before progressing to a second phase characterized by neurological symptoms. In this phase, individuals may experience fever recurrence, stiff neck, headache, confusion, drowsiness, sensitivity to light (photophobia), and in some cases, motor abnormalities or seizures.

Severe cases can result in complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, or myelitis, which involve inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, the brain itself, and the spinal cord, respectively. Although LCM is not typically fatal, it can cause serious health issues, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, infants, and pregnant women. If a woman contracts LCM during pregnancy, the virus can cross the placenta and lead to congenital infection, which may result in significant neurological damage or developmental abnormalities in the fetus.

This information is intended for general understanding and is not a substitute for medical advice. Anyone experiencing symptoms consistent with LCM should consult a healthcare professional for evaluation and appropriate care. Let me know if you'd like more details on transmission, diagnosis, or treatment.","Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM) can cause a variety of symptoms, which may include:

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Alkhurma Hemorrhagic Fever (AHF) ?,"Based on limited information, after an incubation period that could be as short as 2-4 days, the disease presents initially with non-specific flu-like symptoms, including fever, anorexia (loss of appetite), general malaise, diarrhea, and vomiting; a second phase has appeared in some patients, and includes neurologic and hemorrhagic symptoms in severe form. Multi-organ failure precedes fatal outcomes. No repeated or chronic symptoms have been reported following recovery. Evidence suggests that a milder form may exist, where hospitalization is not required. 
                
Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver enzymes are nearly always observed in patients who have been hospitalized.","Alkhurma Hemorrhagic Fever (AHF) is a rare but potentially severe viral illness caused by the Alkhurma virus, a member of the Flavivirus family. It has primarily been reported in Saudi Arabia and neighboring regions, with transmission thought to occur through contact with infected animals—particularly livestock—ticks, or contaminated animal products such as raw milk or meat. The illness begins suddenly, typically with nonspecific symptoms that can resemble many other viral infections. These early symptoms often include high fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and sometimes diarrhea.

As the disease progresses, more severe complications may develop. These can include bleeding manifestations such as nosebleeds, gum bleeding, or other signs of hemorrhage. Some patients may develop jaundice, indicating liver involvement, and neurological symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or even coma. Inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and liver (hepatitis) have also been reported in more severe cases. While not all individuals infected with the virus will develop life-threatening symptoms, the potential for serious complications—including death—makes early recognition and supportive care essential.

Because of the overlap with other febrile and hemorrhagic illnesses, laboratory confirmation is necessary for diagnosis. There is currently no specific antiviral treatment for Alkhurma Hemorrhagic Fever; care is supportive and aimed at managing symptoms and preventing complications. As with other viral hemorrhagic fevers, this information is not a substitute for medical advice, and anyone who may have been exposed to the virus or is experiencing similar symptoms should seek immediate medical attention.

symptoms,what are the signs and symptoms of rabies?,"The first symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu including general weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. These symptoms may last for days.
                
There may be also discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of bite, progressing within days to symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, agitation. As the disease progresses, the person may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, and insomnia.
                
The acute period of disease typically ends after 2 to 10 days. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, and treatment is typically supportive.
                
Disease prevention includes administration of both passive antibody, through an injection of human immune globulin and a round of injections with rabies vaccine.
                
Once a person begins to exhibit signs of the disease, survival is rare. To date less than 10 documented cases of human survival from clinical rabies have been reported and only two have not had a history of pre- or postexposure prophylaxis.","Rabies is a viral disease that affects the central nervous system and is nearly always fatal once clinical symptoms appear. It is typically transmitted to humans through the bite or scratch of an infected animal, most commonly dogs, bats, raccoons, skunks, or foxes. The virus travels through the nervous system toward the brain, and the incubation period can vary from a few weeks to several months, depending on factors such as the location of the exposure and the amount of virus introduced.

The initial signs and symptoms of rabies are often nonspecific and may resemble a mild viral illness. These early symptoms can include fever, headache, fatigue, general weakness, and discomfort or pain at the site of the bite, which may be accompanied by tingling or burning sensations. As the virus progresses and reaches the brain, more severe neurological symptoms begin to appear. These can include anxiety, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, insomnia, and difficulty swallowing. A hallmark sign of rabies is hydrophobia, or fear of water, due to painful spasms in the throat when attempting to drink. As the disease advances, patients may develop paralysis, seizures, and eventually lapse into coma.

There are two main forms of rabies: the more common encephalitic or ""furious"" rabies, which is marked by hyperactivity, aggression, and fluctuating consciousness, and the paralytic or ""dumb"" form, which progresses more slowly and is characterized by muscle weakness and eventual paralysis. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is almost always fatal. However, rabies is entirely preventable if appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is administered promptly after exposure. This information is not medical advice; anyone who may have been exposed to rabies should seek immediate medical evaluation to determine the appropriate course of action.

symptoms,what are the symptoms of botulism?,"The classic symptoms of botulism include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. Infants with botulism appear lethargic, feed poorly, are constipated, and have a weak cry and poor muscle tone. These are all symptoms of the muscle paralysis caused by the bacterial toxin. If untreated, these symptoms may progress to cause paralysis of the respiratory muscles, arms, legs, and trunk. In foodborne botulism, symptoms generally begin 18 to 36 hours after eating a contaminated food, but they can occur as early as 6 hours or as late as 10 days.","Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by toxins produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Symptoms typically begin 12 to 36 hours after exposure, though they can appear as early as a few hours or as late as several days. Initial signs include difficulty swallowing or speaking, dry mouth, facial weakness on both sides, blurred or double vision, and drooping eyelids. As the toxin affects the nervous system, individuals may experience trouble breathing, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and, in severe cases, paralysis. Wound botulism presents similarly but may also include localized pain and swelling at the infection site.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Marburg hemorrhagic fever (Marburg HF) ?,"After an incubation period of 5-10 days, symptom onset is sudden and marked by fever, chills, headache, and myalgia. Around the fifth day after the onset of symptoms, a maculopapular rash, most prominent on the trunk (chest, back, stomach), may occur. Nausea, vomiting, chest pain, a sore throat, abdominal pain, and diarrhea may then appear. Symptoms become increasingly severe and can include jaundice, inflammation of the pancreas, severe weight loss, delirium, shock, liver failure, massive hemorrhaging, and multi-organ dysfunction. 
 
Because many of the signs and symptoms of Marburg hemorrhagic fever are similar to those of other infectious diseases such as malaria or typhoid fever, clinical diagnosis of the disease can be difficult, especially if only a single case is involved.

The symptoms of Marburg HF typically begin abruptly, following an incubation period of 2 to 21 days after exposure. Initial symptoms often resemble those of many other infectious diseases and include a sudden onset of high fever, severe headache, muscle aches, and general malaise. As the disease progresses, more serious symptoms develop, including severe watery diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping, nausea, and vomiting—these gastrointestinal symptoms often appear within the first week of illness and may be accompanied by weight loss, lethargy, and extreme weakness. In the more severe stages, patients may experience hemorrhagic manifestations such as bleeding from the gums, nose, eyes, or gastrointestinal tract, along with bruising and internal bleeding. Rash, delirium, liver failure, and multi-organ dysfunction can also occur. Due to the non-specific nature of early symptoms and the rapid progression of the disease, Marburg HF requires urgent medical evaluation and isolation protocols to prevent transmission.

     - Ulcers
     - Nodules sometimes draining and spreading along lymph nodes","Nocardiosis is an uncommon but serious infection caused by bacteria from the Nocardia genus, which are found in soil, decaying organic matter, and water. The symptoms of nocardiosis can vary widely depending on the site of infection, but the lungs are most commonly affected. Pulmonary nocardiosis often presents with symptoms similar to other respiratory infections such as pneumonia or tuberculosis. These may include a persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. In some cases, the cough may produce sputum that contains blood.

If the infection spreads beyond the lungs (disseminated nocardiosis), it can affect the brain, skin, or other organs. When the central nervous system is involved, symptoms may include headache, confusion, seizures, or neurological deficits, depending on the area affected. Cutaneous (skin) nocardiosis may result from direct inoculation through wounds and typically presents as painful, inflamed skin lesions, abscesses, or ulcers, which can become chronic or draining. People with weakened immune systems—such as those undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients, or individuals with HIV/AIDS—are at higher risk for severe or disseminated forms of nocardiosis. Because its symptoms can mimic other conditions and may develop slowly, timely diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment are crucial. It’s important to consult a healthcare professional for evaluation and management if nocardiosis is suspected, as this response is not a substitute for medical advice.

However, on the basis of limited information, it appears that symptoms may develop between 1 and 5 weeks after exposure to fresh urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents.
  Early Symptoms
  
    
   
Early symptoms include fatigue, fever and muscle aches, especially in the large muscle groupsâ€”thighs, hips, back, and sometimes shoulders. These symptoms are universal.
   
There may also be headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. About half of all HPS patients experience these symptoms.
  
  Late Symptoms
  
    
   
Four to 10 days after the initial phase of illness, the late symptoms of HPS appear. These include coughing and shortness of breath, with the sensation of, as one survivor put it, a ""...tight band around my chest and a pillow over my face"" as the lungs fill with fluid.
  
  Is the Disease Fatal?
  
Yes. HPS can be fatal. It has a mortality rate of 38%.","Hantavirus infection can lead to two serious illnesses in humans: **Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS)**, more commonly seen in the Americas, and **Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS)**, which is more prevalent in Europe and Asia. Both conditions are caused by different strains of hantavirus and are typically transmitted to humans through inhalation of aerosolized particles from rodent urine, droppings, or saliva.

In **Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS)**, early symptoms usually appear 1 to 8 weeks after exposure and can include fever, fatigue, muscle aches (especially in the hips, back, and thighs), headaches, dizziness, chills, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. Within a few days, the illness can progress rapidly to a cardiopulmonary phase characterized by coughing, shortness of breath, and fluid accumulation in the lungs, often leading to respiratory failure. This phase is critical and requires immediate medical attention, as it can be fatal without intensive care.

In **Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS)**, the infection typically begins with similar flu-like symptoms: sudden fever, severe headaches, abdominal and back pain, and blurred vision. As the disease progresses, symptoms can include low blood pressure, acute shock, vascular leakage, and kidney dysfunction, sometimes requiring dialysis. Hemorrhagic symptoms such as petechiae, internal bleeding, or bleeding from mucous membranes may also occur.

Because the symptoms of hantavirus infections can overlap with those of other illnesses and may escalate rapidly, early recognition and supportive medical care are crucial.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Q Fever ?,"Q fever can cause acute or chronic illness in humans, who usually acquire infection after contact with infected animals or exposure to contaminated environments. The acute symptoms caused by infection with Coxiella burnetii usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected withC. burnetii do not show symptoms. 
 
The following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with acute Q fever. However, it is important to note that the combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person. 
  
  - high fevers (up to 104-105Â°F)  
  - severe headache  
  - general malaise  
  - myalgia  
  - chills and/or sweats  
  - non-productive cough  
  - nausea  
  - vomiting  
  - diarrhea  
  - abdominal pain  
  - chest pain  
  
 
Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), myocarditis (inflammation of the heart tissue) and central nervous system complications. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage. The estimated case fatality rate (i.e. the proportion of persons who die as a result of their infection) is low,  at < 2% of hospitalized patients. Treatment with the correct antibiotic may shorten the course of illness for acute Q fever.  
 
Chronic Q fever is a severe disease occurring in <5% of acutely infected patients. It may present soon (within 6 weeks) after an acute infection, or may manifest years later.  The three groups at highest risk for chronic Q fever are pregnant women, immunosuppressed persons and patients with a pre-existing heart valve defects. Endocarditis is the major form of chronic disease, comprising 60-70% of all reported cases. The estimated case fatality rate in untreated patients with endocarditis is 25-60%. Patients with endocarditis require early diagnosis and long-term antibiotic treatment (at least 18 months) for a successful outcome.   Other forms of chronic Q fever include aortic aneurysms and infections of the bone, liver or reproductive organs, such as the testes in males. 
 
Coxiella burnetii has the ability to persist for long periods of time in the host after infection. Although the majority of people with acute Q fever recover completely, a post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported to occur in 10-25% of some acute patients. This syndrome is characterized by constant or recurring fatigue, night sweats, severe headaches, photophobia (eye sensitivity to light), pain in muscles and joints, mood changes, and difficulty sleeping.  
 
 
 Physician Diagnosis 
 
There are several aspects of Q fever that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat.  The symptoms vary from patient to patient and can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases.  Treatment is more likely to be effective if started in the first three days of symptoms. Diagnostic tests based on the detection of antibodies will frequently appear negative in the first 7-10 days of illness.  For this reason, healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone. Healthcare providers may find important information in the patientâ€™s history and physical examination that may aid clinical diagnosis. Information such as recent travel to rural or agricultural communities where infected livestock may be present, or employment in high risk occupations such as veterinarians or farmers can be helpful in making the diagnosis.  Chronic Q fever is a risk for anyone with a history of acute Q fever illness, particularly those persons with valvular disease, blood vessel abnormalities, immunosuppressed persons, and women who were pregnant when they became infected.  
 
The healthcare provider should also look at routine blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. Clues such as a prolonged fever with low platelet count, normal leukocyte count, and elevated liver enzymes are suggestive of acute Q fever infection, but may not be present in all patients.  After a suspect diagnosis is made based on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun, specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of Q fever. 
 
Suspect diagnosis of Q fever is made based on signs and symptoms and a high index of clinical suspicion.  Diagnosis can later be confirmed using specialized confirmatory laboratory tests. Treatment should never be delayed pending the receipt of laboratory test results, or be withheld on the basis of an initial negative laboratory result. 
 
  
 
 
 Laboratory Confirmation 
 
During the acute phase of illness, a sample of whole blood can be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to determine if a patient has Q fever. This method is most sensitive in the first week of illness, and rapidly decreases in sensitivity following the administration of appropriate antibiotics. PCR or immunohistochemistry of biopsy specimens has also been used to diagnose Q fever. These tests may be appropriate for endocarditis patients undergoing valve replacement surgery or patients with hepatitis. Although a positive PCR result is helpful, a negative result does not rule out the diagnosis, and treatment should not be withheld due to a negative result. Culture isolation of C. burnetii is only available at specialized laboratories; routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect the organism.  
 
When a person develops Q fever, their immune system produces antibodies to C. burnetii, with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset.  It is important to note that a negative test during the first week of illness does not rule out Q fever as a cause of illness. There are two distinct antigenic phases to which humans develop antibody responses. In acute infection, an antibody response to C. burnetii Phase II antigen is predominant and is higher than Phase I antibody response; the reverse is true in chronic infection which is associated with a rising Phase I IgG titer (according to current U.S. case definitions >1:800) that is often much higher than Phase II IgG.  The gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of acute Q fever is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using C. burnetii antigen, performed on paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titers. The first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the first week of symptoms, and the second sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. In most cases of Q fever, the first IgG IFA titer is typically low, or â€śnegative,â€ť and the second typically shows a significant (four-fold) increase in IgG antibody levels. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or longer.  Also, IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive.  For these reasons, physicians should request both Phase I and Phase II IgG and IgM serologic titers for diagnostic confirmation of acute and chronic Q fever.  Antibodies to C. burnetii may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved, or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms.  Approximately 3% of currently healthy people in the U.S. general population and up to 20% of people in high-risk professions (veterinarians, ranchers, etc.) have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to C. burnetii. Therefore, if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret the findings.  
 
Paired samples taken 2-3 weeks apart demonstrating a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titer provides the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of acute Q fever. Diagnosis of chronic Q fever is confirmed by elevated Phase I IgG antibody (according to current U.S. case definitions >1:800 and higher than Phase II IgG) and an identifiable persistent focus of infection (e.g. endocarditis).  Elevated Phase I titers alone do not confirm a chronic Q fever diagnosis and would not warrant treatment in a clinically normal patient. Because chronic Q fever involves lengthy persistence of the organism in the body, the antibody levels are often quite high and you will not see a rising titer between paired serum specimens.

 Treatment 
 
Doxycycline is the first line treatment for all adults, and for children with severe illness. Treatment should be initiated immediately whenever Q fever is suspected. 
 
Use of antibiotics other than doxycycline or other tetracyclines is associated with a higher risk of severe illness. Doxycycline is most effective at preventing severe complications from developing if it is started early in the course of disease. Therefore, treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return. 
 
If the patient is treated within the first 3 days of the disease, fever generally subsides within 72 hours.  In fact, failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patientâ€™s condition might not be due to Q fever. Severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves. Resistance to doxcycline has not been documented.  
 
There is no role for prophylactic antimicrobial agents in preventing Q fever after a known exposure and prior to symptom onset; attempts at prophylaxis will likely extend the incubation period by several days but will not prevent infection from occurring.  
 
Recommended Dosage for Acute Q fever
 Doxycycline is the first line treatment for children with severe illness of all ages and adults: 
  
  - Adults: 100 mg every 12 hours  
  - Children under 45 kg (100 lbs): 2.2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day  
  
 
Patients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. Standard duration of treatment is 2-3 weeks.  
 
Recommended Dosage for Chronic Q fever 
  
  - Adults: Doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg every 8 hours. 
  
 
Standard duration of treatment is 18 months. 
 
 
 Treating children 
 
The use of doxycycline is recommended to treat Q fever in children of all ages who are hospitalized or are severely ill. Unlike older generations of tetracyclines, doxycycline has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth, and most experts consider the benefit of doxycycline in treating Q fever in children younger than 8 years of age with severe illness or who are hospitalized greater than the potential risk of dental staining.  Children with mild illness who are less than 8 years of age may be treated with co-trimoxazole, but therapy should be switched to doxycycline if their course of illness worsens. 
 
 
 Other Treatments 
 
In cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in pregnant patients, physicians may need to consider alternate antibiotics. Treatment of pregnant women diagnosed with acute Q fever with once daily co-trimoxazole throughout pregnancy has been shown to significantly decrease the risk of adverse consequences for the fetus.","Q Fever is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium *Coxiella burnetii*, which primarily affects individuals exposed to livestock such as cattle, sheep, and goats. Humans typically become infected by inhaling contaminated dust particles from the feces, urine, milk, or birth products of infected animals. The symptoms of Q Fever can vary widely, ranging from mild to severe, and some individuals may remain completely asymptomatic.

When symptoms do occur, **acute Q Fever** typically presents within 2 to 3 weeks after exposure and is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever, severe headache (often behind the eyes), muscle aches, chills, fatigue, and a dry cough. Some patients may also experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and chest pain. Pneumonia and hepatitis (manifesting as elevated liver enzymes) are common complications in acute cases. In rare instances, a skin rash or sensitivity to light (photophobia) may be present.

A more serious but less common form is **chronic Q Fever**, which can develop months or even years after the initial infection, especially in individuals with preexisting heart conditions or weakened immune systems. Chronic Q Fever most commonly presents as endocarditis (infection of the inner lining of the heart), and symptoms may include prolonged fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, and signs of heart failure.

Due to the wide range of presentations and potential for severe outcomes, particularly in chronic cases, early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment are important.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Hendra Virus Disease (HeV) ?,"After an incubation of 9-16 days, infection with Hendra virus can lead to respiratory illness with severe flu-like signs and symptoms. In some cases, illness may progress to encephalitis. 
                
Although infection with Hendra virus is rare, the case fatality is high: 4/7 (57%).","Hendra virus disease (HeV) is a rare but often severe zoonotic infection caused by the *Hendra virus*, which is primarily transmitted from infected horses to humans. The virus is naturally carried by flying foxes (fruit bats) in Australia and can spread to horses when they come into contact with contaminated bodily fluids or excretions. Humans are most commonly exposed through close contact with infected horses or their secretions, but human-to-human transmission has not been documented.

The symptoms of Hendra virus disease in humans typically appear within 5 to 21 days after exposure and may begin with a **mild, flu-like illness**, including fever, headache, fatigue, sore throat, and muscle aches. As the disease progresses, some patients may develop **severe respiratory symptoms**, such as a cough, difficulty breathing, and pneumonia. In more serious cases, the virus can also affect the **central nervous system**, leading to encephalitis, which presents with symptoms such as confusion, drowsiness, seizures, and loss of consciousness. Neurological deterioration can be rapid and potentially fatal.

Even in survivors, long-term complications may occur, and relapsing encephalitis has been reported in rare instances. Due to its high mortality rate and potential for rapid progression, early identification and supportive care in a clinical setting are essential.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) ?,"Chronic fatigue syndrome can be misdiagnosed or overlooked because its symptoms are similar to so many other illnesses. Fatigue, for instance, can be a symptom for hundreds of illnesses. Looking closer at the nature of the symptoms though, can help a doctor distinguish CFS from other illnesses.
  Primary Symptoms
  
As the name chronic fatigue syndrome suggests, fatigue is one part of this illness. With CFS, however, the fatigue is accompanied by other symptoms. In addition, the fatigue is not the kind you might feel after a particularly busy day or week, after a sleepless night, or after a single stressful event. It's a severe, incapacitating fatigue that isn't improved by bed rest and that is often worsened by physical activity or mental exertion. It's an all-encompassing fatigue that can dramatically reduce a person's activity level and stamina.
  
People with CFS function at a significantly lower level of activity than they were capable of before they became ill. The illness results in a substantial reduction in work-related, personal, social, and educational activities.
  
The fatigue of CFS is accompanied by characteristic illness symptoms lasting at least 6 months. These symptoms include:
  
   - increased malaise (extreme exhaustion and sickness) following physical activity or mental exertion
   - problems with sleep
   - difficulties with memory and concentration
   - persistent muscle pain
   - joint pain (without redness or swelling)
   - headache
   - tender lymph nodes in the neck or armpit
   - sore throat
  
  Other Symptoms
  
The symptoms listed above are the symptoms used to diagnose CFS. However, many CFS patients and patients in general may experience other symptoms, including:
  
   - brain fog (feeling like you're in a mental fog)
   - difficulty maintaining an upright position, dizziness, balance problems or fainting
   - allergies or sensitivities to foods, odors, chemicals, medications, or noise
   - irritable bowel
   - chills and night sweats
   - visual disturbances (sensitivity to light, blurring, eye pain)
   - depression or mood problems (irritability, mood swings, anxiety, panic attacks)
  
  
It's important to tell your health care professional if you're experiencing any of these symptoms. You might have CFS, or you might have another treatable disorder. Only a health care professional can diagnose CFS.
  What's the Clinical Course of CFS?
  
The severity of CFS varies from patient to patient. Some people can maintain fairly active lives. For most patients, however, CFS significantly limits their work, school, and family activities for periods of time.
  
While symptoms vary from person to person in number, type, and severity, all CFS patients are limited in what they can do to some degree. CDC studies show that CFS can be as disabling as multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, end-stage renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and similar chronic conditions.
  
CFS often affects patients in cycles: Patients will have periods of illness followed by periods of relative well-being. For some patients, symptoms may diminish or even go into complete remission; however, they often recur at a later point in time. This pattern of remission and relapse makes CFS especially hard for patients to manage. Patients who are in remission may be tempted to overdo activities when they're feeling better, but this overexertion may actually contribute to a relapse.
  
The percentage of CFS patients who recover is unknown, but there is some evidence to indicate that patients benefit when accompanying conditions are identified and treated and when symptoms are managed. High-quality health care is important.","Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), also known as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS), is a complex and debilitating disorder characterized primarily by **persistent and unexplained fatigue** that does not improve with rest and significantly interferes with daily activities. The fatigue is typically **profound**, lasting for **six months or longer**, and is not due to ongoing exertion or any other underlying medical condition that would fully explain it.

One of the hallmark features of ME/CFS is **post-exertional malaise (PEM)**, a worsening of symptoms following even minor physical, mental, or emotional effort, which can last for days or weeks. In addition to fatigue and PEM, individuals often experience **unrefreshing sleep**, where they wake up feeling just as tired as before resting. **Cognitive impairments** are also common, often described as ""brain fog,"" and may include difficulties with concentration, memory, and information processing.

Other symptoms may include **orthostatic intolerance**, where symptoms worsen upon standing or sitting upright and improve when lying down, often leading to dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting. People with ME/CFS may also report **muscle and joint pain** without swelling or redness, **headaches**, **sore throat**, **swollen lymph nodes**, and **increased sensitivity to light, sound, or temperature**.

The severity of symptoms can range from mild to severely disabling, and they often fluctuate over time. There is no single test for ME/CFS, and diagnosis is based on clinical criteria after ruling out other conditions. Because symptoms overlap with many other illnesses, proper diagnosis and management by a healthcare provider experienced in CFS/ME are essential. This summary is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.","1. Persistent and unexplained fatigue that lasts for at least six months and is not improved by rest.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) ?,"The first symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) typically begin 2-14 days after the bite of an infected tick. A tick bite is usually painless and about half of the people who develop RMSF do not remember being bitten. The disease frequently begins as a sudden onset of fever and headache and most people visit a healthcare provider during the first few days of symptoms. Because early symptoms may be non-specific, several visits may occur before the diagnosis of RMSF is made and correct treatment begins. The following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with this disease, however, it is important to note that few people with the disease will develop all symptoms, and the number and combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person. 
 
 - Fever  
 - Rash (occurs 2-5 days after fever, may be absent in some cases; see below) 
 - Headache  
 - Nausea  
 - Vomiting  
 - Abdominal pain (may mimic appendicitis or other causes of acute abdominal pain)  
 - Muscle pain  
 - Lack of appetite  
 - Conjunctival injection (red eyes)  
 
                
RMSF is a serious illness that can be fatal in the first eight days of symptoms if not treated correctly, even in previously healthy people. The progression of the disease varies greatly. Patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication, while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics, prolonged hospitalization or intensive care. 
                
 
Rash 
                
While most people with RMSF (90%) have some type of rash during the course of illness, some people do not develop the rash until late in the disease process, after treatment should have already begun.  Approximately 10% of RMSF patients never develop a rash. It is important for physicians to consider RMSF if other signs and symptoms support a diagnosis, even if a rash is not present. 
                
A classic case of RMSF involves a rash that first appears 2-5 days after the onset of fever as small, flat, pink, non-itchy spots (macules) on the wrists, forearms, and ankles and spreads to include the trunk and sometimes the palms and soles.  Often the rash varies from this description and people who fail to develop a rash, or develop an atypical rash, are at increased risk of being misdiagnosed. 
                
The red to purple, spotted (petechial) rash of RMSF is usually not seen until the sixth day or later after onset of symptoms and occurs in 35-60% of patients with the infection. This is a sign of progression to severe disease, and every attempt should be made to begin treatment before petechiae develop.

Long-term Health Problems 
                
Patients who had a particularly severe infection requiring prolonged hospitalization may have long-term health problems caused by this disease. Rickettsia rickettsii infects the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels. The damage that occurs in the blood vessels results in a disease process called a ""vasculitis"", and bleeding or clotting in the brain or other vital organs may occur. Loss of fluid from damaged vessels can result in loss of circulation to the extremities and damaged fingers, toes or even limbs may ultimately need to be amputated. Patients who suffer this kind of severe vasculitis in the first two weeks of illness may also be left with permanent long-term health problems such as profound neurological deficits, or damage to internal organs. Those who do not have this kind of vascular damage in the initial stages of the disease typically recover fully within several days to months. 
                
 
Infection in Children 
                
Children with RMSF infection may experience nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Children are less likely to report a headache, but more likely to develop an early rash than adults. Other frequently observed signs and symptoms in children with RMSF are abdominal pain, altered mental status, and conjunctival injection. Occasionally, symptoms like cough, sore throat, and diarrhea may be seen, and can lead to misdiagnosis.

Physician Diagnosis 
                
There are several aspects of RMSF that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat. The symptoms of RMSF vary from patient to patient and can easily resemble other, more common diseases. Treatment for this disease is most effective at preventing death if started in the first five days of symptoms. Diagnostic tests for this disease, especially tests based on the detection of antibodies, will frequently appear negative in the first 7-10 days of illness. Due to the complexities of this disease and the limitations of currently available diagnostic tests, there is no test available at this time that can provide a conclusive result in time to make important decisions about treatment. 
                
For this reason, healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone. Healthcare providers may find important information in the patientâ€™s history and physical examination that may aid clinical suspicion. Information such as recent tick bites, exposure to high grass and tick-infested areas, contact with dogs, similar illnesses in family members or pets, or history of recent travel to areas of high incidence can be helpful in making the diagnosis. Also, information about the presence of symptoms such as fever and rash may be helpful. The healthcare provider may also look at routine blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. Clues such as a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), low sodium levels (hyponatremia), or elevated liver enzyme levels are often helpful predictors of RMSF but may not be present in all patients. After a suspect diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun, specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of RMSF. 
  
  
   
  
 
                
 
Laboratory Confirmation 
                
R. rickettsii infects the endothelial cells that line blood vessels, and does not circulate in large numbers in the blood unless the patient has progressed to a very severe phase of infection. For this reason, blood specimens (whole blood, serum) are not always useful for detection of the organism through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture. If the patient has a rash, PCR or immunohistochemical (IHC) staining can be performed on a skin biopsy taken from the rash site. This test can often deliver a rapid result. These tests have good sensitivity (70%) when applied to tissue specimens collected during the acute phase of illness and before antibiotic treatment has been started, but a negative result should not be used to guide treatment decisions. PCR, culture, and IHC can also be applied to autopsy specimens (liver, spleen, kidney, etc) collected after a patient dies. Culture of R. rickettsii is only available at specialized laboratories; routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect R. rickettsii. 
                
During RMSF infection, a patientâ€™s immune system develops antibodies to R. rickettsii, with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset. It is important to note that antibodies are not detectable in the first week of illness in 85% of patients, and a negative test during this time does not rule out RMSF as a cause of illness. 
                
The gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of RMSF is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with R. rickettsii antigen, performed on two paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titers. The first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the first week of symptoms, and the second sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. In most RMSF cases, the first IgG IFA titer is typically low or negative, and the second typically shows a significant (fourfold) increase in IgG antibody levels. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or even years. Also, IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive. For these reasons, physicians requesting IgM serologic titers should also request a concurrent IgG titer. 
                
Both IgM and IgG levels may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved, or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms. Up to 10% of currently healthy people in some areas may have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to R. rickettsii or similar organisms. Therefore, if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret, whereas two paired samples taken weeks apart demonstrating a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titer provide the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of RMSF.

Treatment 
                
Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever RMSF is suspected.  
                
Use of antibiotics other than doxycycline is associated with a higher risk of fatal outcome. Treatment is most effective at preventing death if doxycycline is started in the first 5 days of symptoms. Therefore, treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return or symptoms of severe disease, such as petechiae, develop. 
                
If the patient is treated within the first 5 days of the disease, fever generally subsides within 24-72 hours. In fact, failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patientâ€™s condition might not be RMSF. Severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves, especially if they have experienced damage to multiple organ systems. Resistance to doxcycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course of treatment have not been documented. 
                
Recommended Dosage
Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages: 
 
 - Adults: 100 mg every 12 hours 
 - Children under 45 kg (100 lbs): 2.2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day 
 
                
Patients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. Standard duration of treatment is 7-14 days. 
Treating Children 
                
The use of doxycycline to treat suspected RMSF in children is standard practice recommended by both CDC and the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases. Use of antibiotics other than doxycycline increases the risk of patient death. Unlike older tetracyclines, the recommended dose and duration of medication needed to treat RMSF has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth, even when five courses are given before the age of eight. Healthcare providers should use doxycycline as the first-line treatment for suspected Rocky Mountain spotted fever in patients of all ages. 
Other Treatments 
                
In cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in some pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of RMSF appears mild, chloramphenicol may be considered as an alternative antibiotic. Oral forumulations of chloramphenicol are not available in the United States, and use of this drug carries the potential for other adverse risks, such as aplastic anemia and Grey baby syndrome. Furthermore, the risk for fatal outcome is elevated in patients who are treated with chloramphenicol compared to those treated with doxycycline. Other antibiotics, including broad spectrum antibiotics are not effective against R. rickettsii, and the use of sulfa drugs may worsen infection. 
Prophylaxis (Preventive Treatment) 
                
Antibiotic treatment following a tick bite is not recommended as a means to prevent RMSF. There is no evidence this practice is effective, and may simply delay onset of disease. Instead, persons who experience a tick bite should be alert for symptoms suggestive of tickborne illness and consult a physician if fever, rash, or other symptoms of concern develop.

Other Considerations 
                
The clinical presentation for RMSF can also resemble other tickborne diseases, such as ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis. Similar to RMSF, these infections respond well to treatment with doxycycline. Healthcare providers should order diagnostic tests for additional agents if the clinical history and geographic association warrant. For more in-depth about other similar tickborne diseases, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm","Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) is a potentially life-threatening tick-borne disease caused by the bacterium *Rickettsia rickettsii*. It is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks, such as the American dog tick, Rocky Mountain wood tick, or brown dog tick. Early recognition and treatment are crucial, as the disease can progress rapidly and lead to severe complications or death if left untreated.

Symptoms of RMSF typically begin **within 2 to 14 days** after a tick bite and usually start with **nonspecific flu-like signs**, including **high fever**, **severe headache**, **muscle pain**, **nausea**, **vomiting**, and **general malaise**. One of the hallmark features of RMSF is a **distinctive rash**, although it may not appear in all cases or may occur later in the course of illness. When present, the rash usually begins 2 to 5 days after the fever starts, initially appearing as small, flat, pink, non-itchy spots on the wrists, forearms, and ankles, before potentially spreading to the trunk, palms, and soles. The rash can later become petechial (dark red or purple spots due to bleeding under the skin), which is a more severe manifestation.

As the infection progresses, RMSF can lead to **vascular damage**, which may result in tissue necrosis, bleeding, or damage to internal organs such as the kidneys, lungs, and brain. Complications can include **neurological symptoms** (e.g., confusion, seizures), **respiratory distress**, and **multi-organ failure**, particularly in untreated or delayed cases.

Given the rapid progression and severity of the disease, RMSF is considered a medical emergency. Early treatment with appropriate antibiotics—typically doxycycline—is essential and most effective when initiated within the first five days of symptoms. This information is for educational purposes only and should not replace consultation with a qualified healthcare professional.","Symptoms of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever may include:

1. Fever
2. Severe headache
3. Muscle pain
4. Chills
5. Fatigue or malaise
6. Nausea and vomiting
7. Abdominal pain
8. Red, non-itchy rash that usually starts on the wrists or ankles
9. Loss of appetite
10. Sensitivity to light (photophobia)
11. Mood or mental changes, such as confusion or delirium
12. Cough
13. Joint pain

These symptoms typically begin about 2 to 14 days after the tick bite. Not everyone with Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever will develop all these symptoms, and the rash, a hallmark sign of the disease, may not appear in the early stages or at all in some people, especially those with darker skin. It's also worth noting that these symptoms can be similar to those of other diseases. Therefore, it's important to seek medical attention if you develop these symptoms and have been in an area where ticks are common.",8.5,7.5,8.62,7.76
symptoms,What are the symptoms of Anaplasmosis ?,"Anaplasmosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilium. This pathogen is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick. The black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) is the vector of A. phagocytophilum in the northeast and upper midwestern United States. The western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus) is the primary vector in Northern California. The first symptoms of anaplasmosis typically begin within 1-2 weeks after the bite of an infected tick. A tick bite is usually painless, and some patients who develop anaplasmosis do not remember being bitten. The following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with this disease. However, it is important to note that few people with the disease will develop all symptoms, and the number and combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person. 
  
  - Fever 
  - Headache 
  - Muscle pain 
  - Malaise 
  - Chills 
  - Nausea / Abdominal pain 
  - Cough 
  - Confusion 
  - Rash (rare with anaplasmosis) 
  
 
Anaplasmosis can be a serious illness that can be fatal if not treated correctly, even in previously healthy people.  Severe clinical presentations may include difficulty breathing, hemorrhage, renal failure or neurological problems. The estimated case fatality rate (i.e., the proportion of persons who die as a result of their infection) is less than 1%. Patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication, while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics, prolonged hospitalization or intensive care. 
 
 
 Rash 
 
Rash is rarely reported in patients with anaplasmosis and the presence of a rash may signify that the patient has a coinfection with the pathogen that causes Lyme disease or another tickborne disease, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever . 
 
 
 Immune-compromised Individuals 
 
The severity of anaplasmosis may depend in part on the immune status of the patient. Persons with compromised immunity caused by immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., corticosteroids, cancer chemotherapy, or longterm immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplant), HIV infection, or splenectomy appear to develop more severe disease, and case-fatality rates for these individuals are characteristically higher than case-fatality rates reported for the general population. 
 
 
 Blood Transfusion and Organ Transplant Risks Associated with Anaplasma species 
 
Because A. phagocytophilum infects the white blood cells and circulates in the blood stream, this pathogen may pose a risk to be transmitted through blood transfusions. Anaplasma phagocytophilum has been shown to survive for more than a week in refrigerated blood. Several cases of anaplasmosis have been reported associated with the transfusion of packed red blood cells donated from asymptomatic or acutely infected donors. Patients who develop anaplasmosis within a month of receiving a blood transfusion or solid organ transplant should be reported to state health officials for prompt investigation. Use of leukoreduced blood products may theoretically decrease the risk of transfusion-associated transmission of these pathogens.  However, the filtration process does not remove all leukocytes or bacteria not associated with leukocytes from leukoreduced blood. Therefore, while this process may reduce the risk of transmission, it does not eliminate it completely. 
 
 
 Physician Diagnosis 
 
There are several aspects of anaplasmosis that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat.  The symptoms vary from patient to patient and can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases.  Treatment is more likely to be effective if started early in the course of disease. Diagnostic tests based on the detection of antibodies will frequently appear negative in the first 7-10 days of illness. 
 
For this reason, healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone. Healthcare providers may find important information in the patientâ€™s history and physical examination that may aid clinical diagnosis. Information such as recent tick bites, exposure to areas where ticks are likely to be found, or history of recent travel to areas where anaplasmosis is endemic can be helpful in making the diagnosis.  The healthcare provider should also look at routine blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. Clues such as a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), low white blood cell count (leukopenia), or elevated liver enzyme levels are helpful predictors of anaplasmosis, but may not be present in all patients.   After a suspect diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun, specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of anaplasmosis. 
   
   
    
   
  
 
 
 Laboratory Detection 
 
During the acute phase of illness, a sample of whole blood can be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to determine if a patient has anaplasmosis. This method is most sensitive in the first week of illness, and rapidly decreases in sensitivity following the administration of appropriate antibiotics. Although a positive PCR result is helpful, a negative result does not completely rule out the diagnosis, and treatment should not be with held due to a negative result. 
 
During the first week of illness a microscopic examination of blood smears (known as a peripheral blood smear) may reveal morulae (microcolonies of anaplasma) in the cytoplasm of white blood cells in up to 20% of patients.  During A. phagocytophilum infection, morulae are most frequently observed in granulocytes. However, the observance of morulae in a particular cell type cannot conclusively identify the infecting species. Culture isolation of A. phagocytophilum is only available at specialized laboratories; routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect the organism. 
 Figure 1: Morulae detected in a granulocyte on a peripheral blood smear, associated with A. phagocytophilum infection. 
  
   
     
    
   
  
 
When a person develops anaplasmosis, their immune system produces antibodies to A. phagocytophilum, with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset.  It is important to note that a negative test during the first week of illness does not rule out anaplasmosis as a cause of illness.  
 
The gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of anaplasmosis is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using A. phagocytophilum antigen, performed on paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titers.  The first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the first week of symptoms, and the second sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. In most cases of anaplasmosis, the first IgG IFA titer is typically low, or â€śnegative,â€ť and the second typically shows a significant (four-fold) increase in IgG antibody levels. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or longer.  Also, IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive.  For these reasons, physicians requesting IgM serologic titers should also request a concurrent IgG titer. 
 
Serologic tests based on enzyme immunoassay (EIA) technology are available from some commercial laboratories. However, EIA tests are qualitative rather than quantitative, meaning they only provide a positive/negative result, and are less useful to measure changes in antibody titers between paired specimens. Furthermore, some EIA assays rely on the evaluation of IgM antibody alone, which may have a higher frequency of false positive results. 
 
Antibodies to A. phagocytophilum may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved, or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms.  Between 5-10% of currently healthy people in some areas may have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to A. phagocytophilum or similar organisms. Therefore, if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret, while paired samples taken weeks apart demonstrating a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titer provides the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of anaplasmosis.

 Treatment 
 
Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever anaplasmosis is suspected.  
 
Use of antibiotics other than doxycycline or other tetracyclines has been associated with a higher risk of fatal outcome for some rickettsial infections. Doxycycline is most effective at preventing severe complications from developing if it is started early in the course of disease. Therefore, treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return. 
 
If the patient is treated within the first 5 days of the disease, fever generally subsides within 24-72 hours.  In fact, failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patientâ€™s condition might not be due to anaplasmosis. Severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves. Resistance to doxcycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course have not been documented.  
 
Recommended Dosage
Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages: 
  
  - Adults: 100 mg every 12 hours 
  - Children under 45 kg (100 lbs): 2.2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day 
  
 
Patients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. Standard duration of treatment is 7 to 14 days. Some patients may continue to experience headache, weakness and malaise for weeks after adequate treatment. 
 Treating children 
 
The use of doxycycline to treat suspected anaplasmosis in children is standard practice recommended by both CDC and the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases. Unlike older generations of tetracyclines, the recommended dose and duration of medication needed to treat anaplasmosis has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth, even when five courses are given before the age of eight.  Healthcare providers should use doxycycline as the first-line treatment for suspected anaplasmosis in patients of all ages.  
 Other Treatments 
 
In cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in some pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of anaplasmosis appears mild, physicians may need to consider alternate antibiotics. Although recommended as a second-line therapeutic alternative to treat Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever , chloramphenicol is not recommended for the treatment of anaplasmosis, as studies have shown a lack of efficacy. Rifampin has been used successfully in several pregnant women with anaplasmosis, and studies suggest that this drug appears effective against Anaplasma species. However, rifampin is not effective in treating RMSF, a disease that may be confused with anaplasmosis. Healthcare providers should be cautious when exploring treatments other than doxycycline, which is highly effective in treating both. Other antibiotics, including broad spectrum antibiotics are not considered highly effective against A. phagocytophilum, and the use of sulfa drugs during acute illness may worsen the severity of infection.  
 Prophylaxis (Preventive Treatment) 
 
Antibiotic treatment following a tick bite is not recommended as a means to prevent anaplasmosis. There is no evidence this practice is effective, and this may simply delay onset of disease. Instead, persons who experience a tick bite should be alert for symptoms suggestive of tickborne illness and consult a physician if fever, rash, or other symptoms of concern develop.

 Other Considerations 
 
The clinical presentation for anaplasmosis can resemble other tickborne diseases, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and ehrlichiosis. Similar to anaplasmosis, these infections respond well to treatment with doxycycline. Healthcare providers should order diagnostic tests for additional agents if the clinical history and geographic association warrant.

Symptoms typically begin **1 to 2 weeks** after a tick bite, and the illness can range from mild to severe, depending on the individual's age, immune status, and timeliness of treatment.

The onset of anaplasmosis is usually **sudden**, with **flu-like symptoms** being most common. These include **fever**, **chills**, **severe headache**, **muscle aches (myalgia)**, and **general malaise**. Other frequent symptoms are **nausea**, **abdominal pain**, **cough**, and occasionally **diarrhea**. Some patients may experience **confusion** or **mental status changes**, especially in severe cases. Unlike other tick-borne illnesses such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, a rash is **not commonly associated** with anaplasmosis, though it may occur rarely.

If left untreated, anaplasmosis can lead to **serious complications**, including **respiratory failure**, **bleeding disorders**, **organ failure**, or **sepsis**, particularly in older adults or those with weakened immune systems. Laboratory findings often show abnormalities such as **low white blood cell count (leukopenia)**, **low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)**, and **elevated liver enzymes**.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Typhoid Fever ?,"Persons with typhoid fever usually have a sustained fever as high as 103Â° to 104Â° F (39Â° to 40Â° C). They may also feel weak, or have stomach pains, headache, or loss of appetite. In some cases, patients have a rash of flat, rose-colored spots. The only way to know for sure if an illness is typhoid fever is to have samples of stool or blood tested for the presence of Salmonella Typhi.

Typhoid feverâ€™s danger doesnâ€™t end when symptoms disappear: 

Even if your symptoms seem to go away, you may still be carrying Salmonella Typhi. If so, the illness could return, or you could pass the disease to other people. In fact, if you work at a job where you handle food or care for small children, you may be barred legally from going back to work until a doctor has determined that you no longer carry any typhoid bacteria.
                
If you are being treated for typhoid fever, it is important to do the following:
                
Keep taking the prescribed antibiotics for as long as the doctor has asked you to take them.
                
Wash your hands carefully with soap and water after using the bathroom, and do not prepare or serve food for other people. This will lower the chance that you will pass the infection on to someone else.
                
Have your doctor perform a series of stool cultures to ensure that no Salmonella Typhi bacteria remain in your body.","Typhoid fever is a systemic bacterial infection caused by *Salmonella enterica* serotype Typhi. It is typically spread through ingestion of contaminated food or water, particularly in areas with inadequate sanitation. The onset of symptoms usually occurs **6 to 30 days** after exposure, and the illness often progresses in a stepwise fashion if left untreated.

Early symptoms are generally **nonspecific** and include **persistent high fever**, which can reach as high as 104°F (40°C), along with **weakness**, **fatigue**, **headache**, and **loss of appetite**. Patients may also experience **abdominal pain**, **constipation** (more common than diarrhea in adults), and **dry cough**. As the disease progresses, individuals may develop **rose-colored spots**—faint, flat, pink rashes—on the trunk, particularly the chest and abdomen. These rashes are more often seen in lighter-skinned individuals and may be harder to detect in others.

Gastrointestinal symptoms often become more pronounced during the second week of illness, with **abdominal distension**, **diarrhea or constipation**, and **enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly)**. In more severe or untreated cases, **complications** such as **intestinal perforation**, **intestinal hemorrhage**, **delirium**, or **sepsis** may occur, especially during the third or fourth week of illness.

Prompt antibiotic treatment can significantly shorten the course of the disease and reduce the risk of complications. Without treatment, typhoid fever can be life-threatening. It’s important to note that even after recovery, some individuals may become **chronic carriers**, capable of shedding the bacteria and transmitting it to others without showing symptoms themselves.

In documented outbreaks of CCHF, fatality rates in hospitalized patients have ranged from 9% to as high as 50%. 
                
The long-term effects of CCHF infection have not been studied well enough in survivors to determine whether or not specific complications exist. However, recovery is slow.","Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a severe and often fatal viral illness caused by the *Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus*, a member of the *Nairovirus* genus in the *Bunyaviridae* family.

It is endemic in parts of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia.

Symptoms of CCHF typically appear **suddenly** after an **incubation period of 1 to 13 days**, depending on the mode of transmission. The illness usually begins with **nonspecific flu-like symptoms**, including **sudden high fever**, **severe headache**, **dizziness**, **muscle aches**, **neck pain**, and **sensitivity to light (photophobia)**. Patients may also experience **sore throat**, **nausea**, **vomiting**, **abdominal pain**, and **diarrhea**, which may later become bloody.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Ehrlichiosis ?,"Symptoms  
                
In the United States, the term â€śehrlichiosisâ€ť may be broadly applied to several different infections. Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Ehrlichia ewingii are transmitted by the lonestar tick in the southeastern and southcentral United States. In addition, a third Ehrlichia species provisionally called Ehrlichia muris-like (EML) has been identified in a small number of patients residing in or traveling to Minnesota and Wisconsin; a tick vector for the EML organism has not yet been established. The symptoms caused by infection with these Ehrlichia species usually develop 1-2 weeks after being bitten by an infected tick.  The tick bite is usually painless, and about half of the people who develop ehrlichiosis may not even remember being bitten by a tick.  
                
 The following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with this disease, however, it is important to note that the combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person. 
 
 - Fever 
 - Headache 
 - Chills 
 - Malaise 
 - Muscle pain 
 - Nausea / Vomiting / Diarrhea 
 - Confusion 
 - Conjunctival injection (red eyes) 
 - Rash (in up to 60% of children, less than 30% of adults) 
 
                
Ehrlichiosis is a serious illness that can be fatal if not treated correctly, even in previously healthy people.  Severe clinical presentations may include difficulty breathing, or bleeding disorders. The estimated case fatality rate (i.e. the proportion of persons who die as a result of their infection) is 1.8%. Patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication, while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics, prolonged hospitalization or intensive care.  
                
 
Rash 
                
Skin rash is not considered a common feature of ehrlichiosis, and should not be used to rule in or rule out an infection. Ehrlichia chaffeensis infection can cause a rash in up to 60% of children, but is reported in fewer than 30% of adults. Rash is not commonly reported in patients infected with Ehrlichia ewingii or the Ehrlichia muris-like organism.  The rash associated with Ehrlichia chaffeensis infection may range from maculopapular to petechial in nature, and is usually not pruritic (itchy). The rash usually spares the face, but in some cases may spread to the palms and soles.  A type of rash called erythroderma may develop in some patients.  Erythroderma is a type of rash that resembles a sunburn and consists of widespread reddening of the skin that may peel after several days.  Some patients may develop a rash that resembles the rash of Rocky Mountain spotted fever making these two diseases difficult to differentiate on the basis of clinical signs alone. 
                
 
Immune-compromised Individuals 
                
The severity of ehrlichiosis may depend in part on the immune status of the patient. Persons with compromised immunity caused by immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., corticosteroids , cancer chemotherapy, or longterm immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplant), HIV infection, or splenectomy appear to develop more severe disease, and may also have higher case-fatality rates (i.e. the proportion of patients that die from infection.)   
                
 
Blood Transfusion and Organ Transplant Risks Associated with Ehrlichia species 
                
Because Ehrlichia organisms infect the white blood cells and circulate in the blood stream, these pathogens may pose a risk to be transmitted through blood transfusions. Ehrlichia chaffeensis has been shown to survive for more than a week in refrigerated blood. Several instances of suspected E. chaffeensis transmission through solid organ transplant have been investigated, although to date no cases have been confirmed that can be attributed to this route of transmission. Patients who develop ehrlichiosis within a month of receiving a blood transfusion or solid organ transplant should be reported to state health officials for prompt investigation. Use of leukoreduced blood products may theoretically decrease the risk of transfusion-associated transmission of these pathogens. However, the filtration process does not remove all leukocytes or bacteria not associated with leukocytes from leukoreduced blood; therefore, this process may not eliminate the risk completely.

Diagnosis 
                
  
                
The diagnosis of ehrlichiosis must be made based on clinical signs and symptoms, and can later be confirmed using specialized confirmatory laboratory tests.  Treatment should never be delayed pending the receipt of laboratory test results, or be withheld on the basis of an initial negative laboratory result.  
Physician Diagnosis 
                
There are several aspects of ehrlichiosis that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat.  The symptoms vary from patient to patient and can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases.  Treatment is more likely to be effective if started early in the course of disease. Diagnostic tests based on the detection of antibodies will frequently be negative in the first 7-10 days of illness. 
                
For this reason, healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone. Healthcare providers may find important information in the patientâ€™s history and physical examination that may aid clinical suspicion. Information such as recent tick bites, exposure to areas where ticks are likely to be found, or history of recent travel to areas where ehrlichiosis is endemic can be helpful in making the diagnosis.  The healthcare provider should also look at routine blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. Clues such as a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), low white blood cell count (leukopenia), or elevated liver enzyme levels are helpful predictors of ehrlichiosis, but may not be present in all patients depending on the course of the disease.   After a suspect diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun, specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of ehrlichiosis. 
                
 
Laboratory Detection 
                
During the acute phase of illness, a sample of whole blood can be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to determine if a patient has ehrlichiosis. This method is most sensitive in the first week of illness, and quickly decreases in sensitivity following the administration of appropriate antibiotics. Although a positive PCR result is helpful, a negative result does not completely rule out the diagnosis. 
                
During the first week of illness a microscopic examination of blood smears (known as a peripheral blood smear) may reveal morulae (microcolonies of ehrlichiae) in the cytoplasm of white blood cells in up to 20% of patients. 
 
   
  
 
                
The type of blood cell in which morulae are observed may provide insight into the infecting species: E. chaffeensis most commonly infects monocytes, whereas E. ewingii more commonly infect granulocytes. However, the observance of morulae in a particular cell type cannot conclusively identify the infecting species. Culture isolation of Ehrlichia is only available at specialized laboratories; routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect Ehrlichia. 
                
When a person develops ehrlichiosis, their immune system produces antibodies to the Ehrlichia, with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset.  It is important to note that antibodies are not detectable in the first week of illness in 85% of patients, and a negative test during this time does not rule out ehrlichiosis as a cause of illness.  
                
The gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of ehrlichiosis is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using E. chaffeensis antigen, performed on paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titers.  The first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the first week of symptoms, and the second sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. In most cases of ehrlichiosis, the first IgG IFA titer is typically low, or â€śnegative,â€ť and the second typically shows a significant (four-fold) increase in IgG antibody levels. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or longer.  Also, IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive.  For these reasons, physicians requesting IgM serologic titers should also request a concurrent IgG titer. 
                
Serologic tests based on enzyme immunoassay (EIA) technology are available from some commercial laboratories. However, EIA tests are qualitative rather than quantitative, meaning they only provide a positive/negative result, and are less useful to measure changes in antibody titers between paired specimens. Furthermore, some EIA assays rely on the evaluation of IgM antibody alone, which may have a higher frequency of false positive results.  
                
Antibodies to E. chaffeensis may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved, or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms.  Up to 12% of currently healthy people in some areas may have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to Ehrlichia species or similar organisms. Therefore, if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret, while paired samples taken weeks apart demonstrating a significant (four-fold) rise in antibody titer provides the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of ehrlichiosis.

Treatment 
                
Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever ehrlichiosis is suspected.  
                
Use of antibiotics other than doxycycline and other tetracyclines is associated with a higher risk of fatal outcome for some rickettsial infections. Doxycycline is most effective at preventing severe complications from developing if it is started early in the course of disease. Therefore, treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return. 
                
If the patient is treated within the first 5 days of the disease, fever generally subsides within 24-72 hours.  In fact, failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patientâ€™s condition might not be due to ehrlichiosis. Severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves. Resistance to doxcycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course have not been documented.  
                
Recommended Dosage 
                
Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages: 
 
 - Adults: 100 mg every 12 hours 
 - Children under 45 kg (100 lbs): 2.2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day 
 
                
Patients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. Standard duration of treatment is 7 to 14 days.  Some patients may continue to experience headache, weakness and malaise for weeks after adequate treatment. 
                
 
Treating children 
                
The use of doxycycline to treat suspected ehrlichiosis in children is standard practice recommended by both CDC and the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases. Unlike older generations of tetracyclines, the recommended dose and duration of medication needed to treat ehrlichiosis has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth, even when five courses are given before the age of eight.  Healthcare providers should use doxycycline as the first-line treatment for suspected ehrlichiosis in patients of all ages.  
                
 
Other Treatments 
                
In cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in some pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of ehrlichiosis appears mild, physicians may need to consider alternate antibiotics. Although recommended as a second-line therapeutic alternative to treat Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), chloramphenicol is not recommended for the treatment of either ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis, as studies have shown a lack of efficacy. Rifampin appears effective against Ehrlichia in laboratory settings. However, rifampin is not effective in treating RMSF, a disease that may be confused with ehrlichiosis. Healthcare providers should be cautious when exploring treatments other than doxycycline, which is highly effective in treating both. Other antibiotics, including broad spectrum antibiotics are not considered highly effective against ehrlichiosis, and the use of sulfa drugs during acute illness may worsen the severity of infection.  
                
 
Prophylaxis (Preventive Treatment) 
                
Antibiotic treatment following a tick bite is not recommended as a means to prevent ehrlichiosis. There is no evidence this practice is effective, and this may simply delay onset of disease. Instead, persons who experience a tick bite should be alert for symptoms suggestive of tickborne illness and consult a physician if fever, rash, or other symptoms of concern develop.

Other Considerations 
                
The clinical presentation for ehrlichiosis can resemble other tickborne diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and anaplasmosis. Similar to ehrlichiosis, these infections respond well to treatment with doxycycline. Healthcare providers should order diagnostic tests for additional agents if the clinical history and geographic association warrant. For more in-depth about other similar tickborne diseases, please visit http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm","Ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne infectious disease caused by bacteria of the *Ehrlichia* genus, primarily *Ehrlichia chaffeensis*, *Ehrlichia ewingii*, and *Ehrlichia muris eauclairensis*. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks, most commonly the **lone star tick** in the United States. The symptoms typically begin **within 1 to 2 weeks** after a tick bite and can range from mild to life-threatening, particularly in older adults or individuals with weakened immune systems.

The **initial symptoms** are often **nonspecific** and resemble those of other tick-borne illnesses. They usually include **sudden onset of fever**, **chills**, **severe headache**, **muscle aches**, **fatigue**, and sometimes **nausea**, **vomiting**, **diarrhea**, or **abdominal pain**. Some patients may also develop a **dry cough** or **joint pain**. A **rash** may occur, particularly in children, but is less common in adults and tends to be more subtle than in diseases like Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.

If left untreated, ehrlichiosis can lead to more severe complications such as **respiratory failure**, **bleeding disorders**, **organ damage**, or **sepsis**. Laboratory findings often reveal **low white blood cell counts (leukopenia)**, **low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia)**, and **elevated liver enzymes**, which can aid in diagnosis. Because the symptoms can be vague and overlap with other illnesses, **early treatment with doxycycline** is critical, even before laboratory confirmation, as delayed therapy increases the risk of serious outcomes.

Acinetobacter may also â€ścolonizeâ€ť or live in a patient without causing infection or symptoms, especially in tracheostomy sites or open wounds.","Acinetobacter infections, particularly those caused by *Acinetobacter baumannii*, are significant healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) that primarily affect individuals who are hospitalized—especially those in intensive care units (ICUs), on ventilators, or with invasive devices like catheters. *Acinetobacter* bacteria are opportunistic pathogens, meaning they mostly cause illness in people with weakened immune systems or serious underlying conditions.

The **symptoms of Acinetobacter infection** vary depending on the site of infection. In healthcare settings, the most common types include:

1. **Pneumonia**, especially **ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)**, which presents with **fever**, **chills**, **cough with or without sputum**, **shortness of breath**, and **chest pain**. Imaging often shows signs of lung infiltrates.

2. **Bloodstream infections (bacteremia or sepsis)** can occur when the bacteria enter the blood through catheters or wounds. Symptoms may include **fever**, **low blood pressure**, **chills**, **rapid heart rate**, **confusion**, and **organ dysfunction**, potentially leading to septic shock.

3. **Wound and surgical site infections**, which may present with **redness**, **swelling**, **pain**, **warmth around the wound**, and **pus or drainage**. These infections are common in patients with traumatic injuries or post-surgical wounds.

4. **Urinary tract infections (UTIs)**, especially in patients with indwelling urinary catheters, may cause **frequent urination**, **painful urination**, **fever**, and **lower abdominal discomfort**.

In some cases, Acinetobacter can also cause **meningitis** (particularly after neurosurgery), with symptoms such as **fever**, **stiff neck**, **sensitivity to light**, and **altered mental status**.

A major concern with *Acinetobacter* is its ability to develop **multi-drug resistance**, making infections difficult to treat and increasing the risk of poor outcomes.

In healthcare settings, the symptoms can be severe as people who are already sick are at a higher risk. Here are some possible symptoms:

1. Fever: This is one of the most common symptoms of an Acinetobacter infection. It's the body's natural response to fighting off the infection.

2. Chills and Sweating: The patient may experience chills and sweating as the body's temperature fluctuates in an attempt to fight off the infection.

3. Shortness of Breath: If the bacteria have infected the lungs and caused pneumonia, the patient may have difficulty breathing.

4. Cough: A persistent cough can also be a sign of pneumonia caused by Acinetobacter.

5. Chest pain: In some cases, the infection may cause discomfort or pain in the chest.

6. Skin redness, pain, or swelling: If the bacteria have infected a wound, these symptoms may be present.

7. Confusion or altered mental status: This can occur if the bacteria spread to the brain causing meningitis.

8. Sepsis: If the infection spreads through the bloodstream, it can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition. Symptoms of sepsis include a high heart rate, fever, shortness of breath, and confusion.

9. Urinary problems: If the urinary tract is infected, the patient may experience pain, discomfort or problems passing urine.

10. Unexplained low blood pressure: This could be a sign of sepsis, a serious complication of an Acinetobacter infection.

Patients may experience abnormally low blood pressure, and low platelet, red blood cell, and white blood cell counts. 
                
After 1-2 weeks of symptoms, some patients recover without complication. However, the illness is biphasic for a subset of patients (10-20%) who experience a second wave of symptoms at the beginning of the third week. These symptoms include fever and signs of neurological manifestations, such as severe headache, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision deficits. 
                
The estimated case-fatality rate is from 3 to 5% for KFD.","Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the *Kyasanur Forest disease virus* (KFDV), a member of the *Flaviviridae* family. The disease is primarily found in forested regions of southern India, particularly in Karnataka, and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected hard ticks, most commonly *Haemaphysalis spinigera*. In some cases, exposure may also occur through contact with infected animals, especially monkeys, which serve as amplifying hosts.

The symptoms of KFD typically begin **3 to 8 days** after a tick bite and can be **sudden and severe**. The illness generally follows a **biphasic pattern**. In the **first phase**, patients commonly experience **high fever**, **severe headache**, **muscle pain**, **fatigue**, **vomiting**, and **gastrointestinal symptoms** such as **diarrhea** or **abdominal pain**. Other symptoms may include **photophobia** (sensitivity to light) and **conjunctival congestion** (red eyes). These initial symptoms can last for about 5 to 12 days.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Lactose Intolerance ?,"Common symptoms of lactose intolerance include
                
- abdominal bloating, a feeling of fullness or swelling in the abdomen  - abdominal pain  - diarrhea  - gas  - nausea
                
Symptoms occur 30 minutes to 2 hours after consuming milk or milk products. Symptoms range from mild to severe based on the amount of lactose the person ate or drank and the amount a person can tolerate.","Lactose intolerance is a common digestive disorder in which the body is unable to properly digest **lactose**, the natural sugar found in milk and dairy products. This occurs due to a deficiency in **lactase**, the enzyme responsible for breaking down lactose in the small intestine. When undigested lactose moves into the colon, it ferments and causes gastrointestinal symptoms.

Symptoms of lactose intolerance typically begin **within 30 minutes to 2 hours** after consuming lactose-containing foods or beverages. The most common symptoms include **bloating**, **abdominal pain or cramping**, **excessive gas**, and **diarrhea**. Some individuals may also experience **nausea**, and in rarer cases, **vomiting**—particularly after consuming large amounts of dairy.

The severity and onset of symptoms can vary depending on the amount of lactose consumed and the individual’s level of lactase deficiency. Some people with lactose intolerance can tolerate small amounts of dairy without significant discomfort, while others may react to even minimal exposure. It is important to note that lactose intolerance is different from a milk allergy, which involves the immune system and can cause more serious reactions.

While lactose intolerance is not life-threatening, it can significantly affect quality of life if not managed properly.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Kidney Stones in Adults ?,"People with kidney stones may have pain while urinating, see blood in the urine, or feel a sharp pain in the back or lower abdomen. The pain may last for a short or long time. People may experience nausea and vomiting with the pain. However, people who have small stones that pass easily through the urinary tract may not have symptoms at all.","**Kidney stones** are hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside the kidneys. In adults, they can cause a range of symptoms depending on the size, location, and whether the stone is moving through the urinary tract. Small stones may pass without causing symptoms, but larger stones or those causing blockage can lead to intense pain and other complications.

### **Common Symptoms of Kidney Stones in Adults:**

1. **Severe pain (renal colic):**
   - The most characteristic symptom is **sudden, intense pain** that usually starts in the **flank or lower back**, just below the ribs.
   - The pain may **radiate to the abdomen, groin, or inner thigh**.
   - It often comes in **waves** and fluctuates in intensity as the stone moves through the ureter.

2. **Pain during urination (dysuria):**
   - Burning or sharp pain while urinating, especially if the stone is near the bladder.

3. **Hematuria (blood in urine):**
   - Urine may appear **pink, red, or brown**, or blood may be microscopic and only detectable through a lab test.

4. **Frequent or urgent need to urinate:**
   - Especially if the stone is lodged near the bladder.

5. **Nausea and vomiting:**
   - Often caused by the pain or due to the stone affecting the gastrointestinal system via shared nerve pathways.

6. **Cloudy or foul-smelling urine:**
   - This may indicate a **urinary tract infection (UTI)**, which can occur alongside or because of the stone.

7. **Fever and chills:**
   - These are signs of an **infection**, which constitutes a **medical emergency** if it accompanies a kidney stone.

### **Note:**
Symptoms vary depending on individual factors and stone size. Some kidney stones may cause **no symptoms** at all and are found incidentally on imaging.

If kidney stones are suspected—especially with severe pain, blood in the urine, or signs of infection—prompt evaluation by a healthcare provider is essential. This summary is for informational purposes and is not a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.","1. Severe, sharp pain in the back or side that may spread to the lower abdomen and groin. The pain may come in waves and fluctuate in intensity.

7. Fever and chills if an infection is present.

8. Feeling the need to urinate even when the bladder is empty.

9. Difficulty sitting still or finding a comfortable position.

10. Blood in the urine (hematuria).

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease ?,"The signs and symptoms of anemia in someone with CKD may include
                
- weakness  - fatigue, or feeling tired  - headaches  - problems with concentration  - paleness  - dizziness  - difficulty breathing or shortness of breath  - chest pain
                
Anyone having difficulty breathing or with shortness of breath should seek immediate medical care. Anyone who has chest pain should call 911.","Anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common complication that occurs as kidney function declines, primarily due to a decreased production of erythropoietin—a hormone made by the kidneys that stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow. As a result, the body is unable to produce enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to tissues and organs. The symptoms of anemia in CKD typically develop gradually and can often be mistaken for general fatigue or aging. Patients commonly experience persistent tiredness, weakness, and a reduced ability to perform physical activities. Shortness of breath may occur even with mild exertion, and some individuals may feel lightheaded or dizzy. Other common symptoms include pale or sallow skin, cold hands and feet, headaches, chest pain, and irregular or fast heartbeat (palpitations), which can worsen existing heart conditions. In more severe cases, individuals may also experience difficulty concentrating or report a sense of mental fog. Because these symptoms can significantly affect quality of life and may worsen as kidney disease progresses, early recognition and treatment of anemia are important. Treatment typically involves managing underlying causes, such as iron deficiency or inflammation, and may include iron supplements, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, or blood transfusions in severe cases. This information is intended for educational purposes and should not replace medical consultation for diagnosis and management.","1. Fatigue or weakness: As anemia in chronic kidney disease worsens, you may feel tired or weak more often.

2. Shortness of breath: A lower red blood cell count means your muscles don't get enough oxygen to function properly. This can make it difficult to breathe, especially during physical activity.

3. Rapid or irregular heartbeat: Your heart may beat faster or irregularly to pump more oxygen-rich blood throughout your body.

4. Pale skin: Red blood cells give your skin its natural color. When there aren't enough red blood cells, your skin may appear pale or yellowish.

5. Chest pain: If anemia in chronic kidney disease is not treated, it can cause chest pain, angina or even heart attack.

6. Dizziness or lightheadedness: If your brain doesn't get enough oxygen, you may feel dizzy or lightheaded. 

7. Difficulty thinking or concentrating: Lack of oxygen can also affect your ability to think clearly and concentrate.

8. Cold hands and feet: Anemia can cause your hands and feet to feel cold. This is because your body is directing most of its limited oxygen supply to your vital organs.

9. Headaches: Some people with anemia in chronic kidney disease may experience frequent headaches. 

10. Decreased appetite or weight loss: Some people with this condition may lose their appetite, leading to weight loss.

Remember, these symptoms can also be caused by other health conditions. If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment.",9.0,9.5,7.76,7.18

- joint pain or swelling  - muscle pain  - fever with no known cause  - red rashes, often on the face, which are also called butterfly rashes because of their shape","Lupus nephritis is a serious kidney inflammation caused by **systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**, an autoimmune disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s own tissues. When lupus affects the kidneys, it leads to lupus nephritis, which can impair their ability to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. The symptoms can range from mild to severe and often develop gradually, sometimes without noticeable signs in the early stages.

Common symptoms of lupus nephritis include **swelling (edema)** in the feet, ankles, legs, hands, or face, due to fluid retention. Patients may notice **foamy urine**, which is a sign of proteinuria—an excess of protein in the urine caused by kidney damage. **High blood pressure** is another frequent symptom, as impaired kidney function affects fluid and salt balance. Some individuals may experience **frequent urination**, especially at night, or **blood in the urine**, which may appear pink, red, or cola-colored. Other symptoms include **weight gain** from fluid buildup, **fatigue**, and in more advanced cases, **nausea**, **loss of appetite**, or **difficulty concentrating**, all of which reflect declining kidney function.

Because lupus nephritis can progress silently and lead to **chronic kidney disease or kidney failure** if untreated, early diagnosis and management are crucial. Diagnosis usually involves urine tests, blood tests, and sometimes a kidney biopsy to determine the severity and type of inflammation. This information is intended for educational purposes only and should not substitute for a healthcare provider’s evaluation and guidance.","1. Blood in the urine: This occurs when the kidneys allow the blood cells to leak into the urine.
   
2. High blood pressure: The kidneys are responsible for regulating blood pressure. When they're not functioning properly, blood pressure can increase.

3. Swelling of the legs, ankles, and/or feet: This is due to fluid retention (edema) caused by the kidneys not being able to remove waste and extra fluid from the body.

4. Weight gain: This can also be caused by fluid retention.

5. Foamy or frothy urine: This can be caused by excess protein in the urine.

6. Frequent urination, especially at night.

7. Fatigue or feeling tired: This can be due to the body's energy being used to try and repair the damage to the kidneys, or due to anemia.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Dermatitis Herpetiformis: Skin Manifestation of Celiac Disease (For Health Care Professionals) ?,"Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterized by small, clustered papules and vesicles that erupt symmetrically on the elbows, knees, buttocks, back, or scalp. The face and groin can also be involved. A burning sensation may precede lesion formation. Lesions are usually scratched off by the time a patient comes in for a physical exam, and the rash may appear as erosions and excoriations.
                
Patients with DH may also experience dental enamel defects to permanent teeth, which is another manifestation of celiac disease. Less than 20 percent of people with DH have symptoms of celiac disease.3","**Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH)** is a chronic, intensely pruritic skin condition that represents the cutaneous manifestation of **celiac disease** and is considered pathognomonic for gluten sensitivity. It typically affects adults between the ages of 20 and 40 but can also present in children and older adults. While most patients with DH have some degree of small intestinal involvement characteristic of celiac disease, many are **asymptomatic from a gastrointestinal standpoint**, making the skin findings a critical clue for diagnosis.

Clinically, DH is characterized by **clusters of erythematous papules, vesicles, and urticarial plaques** that are extremely **itchy and burning** in nature. Lesions most commonly appear symmetrically on **extensor surfaces** such as the **elbows, knees, buttocks, lower back, and scalp**, and are often excoriated due to scratching. New lesions may resemble herpetic vesicles, hence the name, but DH is not related to the herpes virus. Vesicles are often fragile and may rupture easily, leaving behind erosions and crusts.

Histopathologically, skin biopsy from lesional or perilesional skin reveals **neutrophilic microabscesses** in the dermal papillae and **granular IgA deposits** along the dermoepidermal junction, confirmed by **direct immunofluorescence**—a diagnostic hallmark. Serological testing for **anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG)** and **anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA)**, often positive in DH, further supports the diagnosis and helps assess for underlying celiac disease.

Management includes a **strict gluten-free diet**, which addresses both cutaneous and intestinal manifestations and reduces the long-term risk of complications such as enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. **Dapsone** is highly effective for rapid relief of cutaneous symptoms but requires regular monitoring due to potential hematologic and hepatic side effects.

This overview is intended for healthcare professionals and should be integrated into a broader diagnostic and therapeutic framework, ideally involving dermatology and gastroenterology collaboration for optimal management of both skin and systemic disease manifestations.","Dermatitis Herpetiformis (DH) is a chronic skin condition characterized by intensely itchy blisters and red, inflamed skin patches. It is associated with gluten sensitivity, similar to celiac disease. Here are the main symptoms:

1. Intensely itchy rash: This is the primary symptom of DH. The itchiness can be severe and may occur before the rash appears.

2. Blisters or vesicles: The rash usually consists of small, clustered papules and vesicles that are filled with a watery fluid. They may look like hives or eczema initially.

3. Red, inflamed skin: The skin around the blisters is usually red and inflamed. 

4. Symmetrical rash: The rash is often symmetrical, and typically appears on the elbows, knees, back, buttocks, scalp, and hairline.

5. Scratch marks and skin erosion: Due to the intense itching, patients often scratch, which can lead to scratch marks, crusts, and areas of skin erosion.

6. Periodic outbreaks: The rash may come and go, especially in response to consumption of gluten.

7. Possible gastrointestinal symptoms: Some individuals with DH may also experience symptoms of celiac disease, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating. However, many people with DH have no digestive symptoms.

8. Nutritional deficiencies: As with celiac disease, people with DH may have difficulty absorbing nutrients from their food, leading to deficiencies, such as iron-deficiency anemia or osteoporosis.

The diagnosis of DH is typically confirmed by a skin biopsy, blood tests for certain antibodies, and often an intestinal biopsy to check for damage typical of celiac disease. The main treatment for DH is a lifelong gluten-free diet, which helps to control both the skin symptoms and any digestive symptoms.",9.5,9.0,8.75,7.54

The lungs are usually affected before or at the same time as the kidneys, and symptoms can include shortness of breath and coughing, sometimes with blood. The progression from initial symptoms to the lungs being affected may be very rapid. Symptoms that occur when the kidneys are affected include blood in the urine or foamy urine, swelling in the legs, and high blood pressure.","**Goodpasture syndrome**—also known as **anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease**—is a rare and potentially life-threatening autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of circulating anti-GBM antibodies that target the basement membranes of both the **kidneys** and the **lungs**. This immune-mediated attack leads to **rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis** and **pulmonary hemorrhage**, the hallmark features of the syndrome. Symptoms can develop suddenly and worsen quickly, making early recognition and treatment critical.

### **Renal (Kidney) Symptoms:**
Kidney involvement often presents first or concurrently and includes signs of **rapidly progressive renal failure**, such as:
- **Hematuria** (blood in the urine, often described as cola-colored)
- **Proteinuria** (excess protein in the urine)
- **Oliguria** or **anuria** (reduced or absent urine output in advanced stages)
- **Edema**, especially in the legs or around the eyes, due to fluid retention
- **Hypertension**
- **Elevated serum creatinine** and **urea levels**, indicating declining kidney function

### **Pulmonary (Lung) Symptoms:**
Lung involvement is due to alveolar hemorrhage and may include:
- **Hemoptysis** (coughing up blood), which may be mild or massive
- **Cough**
- **Shortness of breath**
- **Chest discomfort or pain**
- **Fatigue or pallor**, often from anemia due to blood loss

### **Systemic Symptoms:**
In some patients, generalized symptoms such as **malaise**, **fever**, **weight loss**, and **weakness** may also occur, though they are less specific.

Goodpasture syndrome typically affects young males in their teens or twenties and older adults over 60. Risk factors may include exposure to smoking, hydrocarbon solvents, or respiratory infections, which are believed to trigger the autoimmune response in genetically predisposed individuals.

Diagnosis is confirmed through **serologic testing for anti-GBM antibodies**, **renal biopsy** showing linear IgG deposition along the basement membrane, and often **chest imaging** to evaluate pulmonary involvement. Treatment is urgent and typically includes **plasmapheresis** to remove circulating antibodies, along with **high-dose corticosteroids** and **immunosuppressive therapy** (e.g., cyclophosphamide).

This information is intended for healthcare professionals and should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment and specialist consultation for diagnosis and management.","1. Fatigue and weakness: Due to anemia caused by kidney damage.

2. Shortness of breath: It may occur due to fluid buildup in the lungs or due to bleeding in the lungs.

3. Nausea and vomiting: These symptoms can occur as a result of the body's inability to properly filter waste due to kidney damage.

4. Pale skin: Anemia, which can be caused by kidney damage, can result in pale skin.

5. Hematuria (blood in the urine): This results from damage to the kidneys.

6. Coughing up blood: This can occur if there is bleeding in the lungs.

7. Swelling in hands and feet: This can be caused by fluid retention due to kidney damage.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of What I need to know about Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome ?,"Signs of bladder problems include
                
-  Urgency. The feeling that you need to go right now! Urgency is normal if you haven't been near a bathroom for a few hours or if you have been drinking a lot of fluids. But you may have a problem if you have strong urges before your bladder has had time to fill. All of a sudden, you feel a strong urge to go. At times, you may even have an accident because the urge strikes so quickly you don't have time to find a bathroom.    - Frequency. The feeling that you need to go much more often than anyone else. Doctors and nurses use the term void, which means to empty the bladder. Most people void between four and seven times a day. Drinking large amounts of fluid can cause more frequent voiding. Taking blood pressure medicines called diuretics, or water pills, can also cause more frequent voiding. If you void more than eight times a day, and you dont take diuretics or drink large amounts of fluid, it may be the sign of a problem.  - Pain. The feeling of more than discomfort when you need to go. Having a full bladder may be uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. You may have a problem if you feel burning or sharp pain in your bladder or urethrathe opening where urine leaves the body.
                
Some people may have pain without urgency or frequency. Others have urgency and frequency without pain.","**Interstitial Cystitis (IC)**, also known as **Painful Bladder Syndrome (PBS)**, is a chronic condition characterized by **bladder pain, urinary urgency, and frequency** in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes. It affects both men and women but is significantly more common in women. The symptoms can vary in severity and often fluctuate over time, with periods of flares and remission.

The hallmark symptom is **chronic pelvic or bladder pain**, which may feel like pressure, discomfort, or a burning sensation. This pain often **worsens as the bladder fills** and is temporarily relieved after urination. Many individuals experience **frequent urination**, sometimes up to 40–60 times per day, and **an urgent need to urinate**, often with little urine output. **Nocturia** (waking up multiple times at night to urinate) is also common.

Other symptoms can include **pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia)**, **suprapubic discomfort**, and, in some cases, **pain that radiates to the lower back, abdomen, or thighs**. Unlike urinary tract infections, IC/PBS does not typically present with fever or positive urine cultures, although symptoms may closely resemble those of an infection, making diagnosis challenging.

The condition is **multifactorial** in origin, and its exact cause is unknown, though hypotheses include bladder lining defects, autoimmune responses, or nerve hypersensitivity. Diagnosis is clinical and often one of exclusion, sometimes supported by cystoscopy or bladder biopsy in complex cases.

Because of the chronic nature of IC/PBS and its impact on quality of life, management is typically **multidisciplinary** and may involve **dietary modifications**, **physical therapy**, **bladder training**, **oral medications**, **intravesical therapies**, and, in severe cases, **surgical intervention**.

This information is intended for healthcare professionals and should be interpreted within the context of a comprehensive clinical assessment.","Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome can have a wide array of symptoms, which can vary from person to person and may even fluctuate in the same person over time. These may include:

1. Chronic pelvic pain: A persistent, dull aching pain in the bladder and surrounding pelvic region.

2. Frequent urination: The need to urinate more often than usual, sometimes as often as every 10 minutes.

3. Urgency to urinate: The sensation of needing to urinate immediately, even if the bladder is not full.

4. Pain or discomfort while the bladder fills up and relief after urinating.

5. Pain during sexual intercourse.

6. In women, symptoms can worsen during menstruation.

7. Discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen.

8. A persistent need to urinate, waking up several times during the night to go to the bathroom.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Hematuria (Blood in the Urine) ?,"Most people with microscopic hematuria do not have symptoms. People with gross hematuria have urine that is pink, red, or cola-colored due to the presence of red blood cells (RBCs). Even a small amount of blood in the urine can cause urine to change color. In most cases, people with gross hematuria do not have other symptoms. However, people with gross hematuria that includes blood clots in the urine may have pain.","**Hematuria**, or **blood in the urine**, is a clinical finding rather than a disease itself, and it can be a symptom of a wide range of underlying conditions. It is categorized as either **gross hematuria**, where the blood is visible to the naked eye (urine appears pink, red, or cola-colored), or **microscopic hematuria**, where red blood cells are only detected through urine analysis under a microscope. While hematuria can be benign in some cases, it may also signal a serious urologic or nephrologic condition requiring further investigation.

The symptoms associated with hematuria often depend on the **underlying cause**, and may occur alongside other urinary or systemic signs. In some cases, hematuria is **painless and asymptomatic**, discovered incidentally during routine testing. However, when symptoms are present, they may include **painful urination (dysuria)**, **frequent or urgent urination**, or **suprapubic or flank pain**, suggesting involvement of the bladder or kidneys. **Clots in the urine** may also occur and, if large enough, can cause urinary obstruction and lead to **difficulty urinating** or **urinary retention**.

Common causes of hematuria include **urinary tract infections (UTIs)**, **kidney stones**, **bladder or kidney infections (pyelonephritis)**, **trauma**, **vigorous exercise**, **benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)**, **glomerular disease**, and **urinary tract malignancies**. Less commonly, it can be related to bleeding disorders or certain medications (e.g., anticoagulants).

Given its broad differential, hematuria warrants **thorough evaluation**, particularly in adults over 35 or individuals with risk factors such as smoking or occupational exposure to chemicals. Diagnostic workup may include urinalysis, urine culture, imaging (ultrasound, CT urography), cystoscopy, and sometimes renal biopsy.

This overview is intended for healthcare professionals and should guide a systematic approach to diagnosis and management based on the patient’s presentation and risk profile.","In many cases, people with hematuria do not have other symptoms besides seeing blood in their urine. However, depending on the cause of the hematuria, additional symptoms may include:

1. Pink, red or cola-colored urine from the presence of red blood cells.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Celiac Disease ?,"A person may experience digestive signs and symptoms, or symptoms in other parts of the body. Digestive signs and symptoms are more common in children and can include
                
- abdominal bloating  - chronic diarrhea  - constipation  - gas  - pale, foul-smelling, or fatty stool  - stomach pain  - nausea  - vomiting
                
Being unable to absorb nutrients during the years when nutrition is critical to a child's normal growth and development can lead to other health problems, such as
                
- failure to thrive in infants  - slowed growth and short stature  - weight loss  - irritability or change in mood  - delayed puberty  - dental enamel defects of permanent teeth
                
Adults are less likely to have digestive signs and symptoms and may instead have one or more of the following:
                
- anemia  - bone or joint pain  - canker sores inside the mouth  - depression or anxiety  - dermatitis herpetiformis, an itchy, blistering skin rash  - fatigue, or feeling tired  - infertility or recurrent miscarriage  - missed menstrual periods  - seizures  - tingling numbness in the hands and feet  - weak and brittle bones, or osteoporosis  - headaches
                
Intestinal inflammation can cause other symptoms, such as
                
- feeling tired for long periods of time  - abdominal pain and bloating  - ulcers  - blockages in the intestine
                
Celiac disease can produce an autoimmune reaction, or a self-directed immune reaction, in which a person's immune system attacks healthy cells in the body. This reaction can spread outside of the gastrointestinal tract to affect other areas of the body, including the
                
- spleen  - skin  - nervous system  - bones  - joints
                
Recognizing celiac disease can be difficult because some of its symptoms are similar to those of other diseases and conditions. Celiac disease can be confused with
                
- irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  - iron-deficiency anemia caused by menstrual blood loss  - lactose intolerance  - inflammatory bowel disease  - diverticulitis  - intestinal infections  - chronic fatigue syndrome
                
As a result, celiac disease has long been underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. As health care providers become more aware of the many varied symptoms of the disease and reliable blood tests become more available, diagnosis rates are increasing, particularly for adults.
                

                
Dermatitis Herpetiformis   Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic, itchy, blistering skin rashusually on the elbows, knees, buttocks, back, or scalpthat affects about 5 to 10 percent of people with celiac disease.3 Men with dermatitis herpetiformis may also have oral or genital lesions. People with dermatitis herpetiformis may have no other signs or symptoms of celiac disease. Skin deposits of antibodiesproteins that react against the body's own cells or tissuescommon in celiac disease cause dermatitis herpetiformis. Ingesting gluten triggers these antibodies.   More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Dermatitis Herpetiformis: Skin Manifestation of Celiac Disease.","**Celiac disease** is a chronic autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of **gluten**, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, in genetically predisposed individuals. When people with celiac disease consume gluten, their immune system mounts an inappropriate response that damages the **small intestine’s mucosal lining**, particularly the **villi**, which are essential for nutrient absorption. This results in a wide range of **gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms**, and the disease can vary greatly in presentation, severity, and age of onset.

### **Gastrointestinal Symptoms:**
These are more common in children but can occur at any age and include:
- **Chronic diarrhea or constipation**
- **Abdominal pain and bloating**
- **Gas and flatulence**
- **Nausea and vomiting**
- **Fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea)**
- **Unintended weight loss**
- **Malabsorption-related symptoms**, such as fatigue or signs of vitamin and mineral deficiencies

### **Extraintestinal Symptoms:**
These are more frequently observed in adults and may be the only signs of the disease:
- **Iron-deficiency anemia** that does not respond to iron therapy
- **Fatigue**
- **Bone or joint pain**
- **Osteopenia or osteoporosis**
- **Neurological symptoms** such as tingling or numbness (peripheral neuropathy), headaches, and even ataxia
- **Menstrual irregularities or infertility**
- **Depression or irritability**
- **Dermatitis herpetiformis**, an intensely itchy, blistering skin rash (specific to celiac disease)

In children, untreated celiac disease can lead to **delayed growth and puberty**, **short stature**, **dental enamel defects**, and **behavioral issues** such as attention deficits or irritability.

Because celiac disease symptoms can mimic many other conditions or be entirely silent (especially in asymptomatic or “silent” celiac disease), **serologic testing** (e.g., anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA) and **intestinal biopsy** are essential for diagnosis. A strict, lifelong **gluten-free diet** is the only effective treatment, which typically leads to resolution of symptoms and healing of intestinal damage.

This information is intended for educational use by healthcare professionals and should be applied in the context of a thorough clinical evaluation.","1. Diarrhea: This is one of the most common symptoms. The diarrhea caused by celiac disease is chronic and may contain fat, resulting in foul-smelling stools.

2. Bloating: Another common symptom is bloating, or a feeling of fullness or swelling in the abdomen.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Prevent diabetes problems: Keep your nervous system healthy ?,"Nerve damage symptoms depend on which nerves have damage. Some people have no symptoms or mild symptoms. Other people have painful and long-lasting symptoms. As most nerve damage develops over many years, a person may not notice mild cases for a long time. In some people, the onset of pain may be sudden and severe.","To prevent diabetes-related nerve problems (known as diabetic neuropathy), it's important to understand the early warning signs and how to maintain a healthy nervous system. Diabetic neuropathy can develop over time due to persistently high blood sugar levels damaging the nerves throughout the body—especially in the legs and feet.

Early Symptoms of Diabetic Nerve Damage:
Tingling, burning, or ""pins and needles"" sensations in the hands or feet

Numbness or reduced ability to feel pain or temperature changes

Sharp or jabbing pain, especially at night

Muscle weakness or difficulty walking

Increased sensitivity to touch

Advanced Symptoms:
Loss of coordination and balance

Digestive issues (bloating, nausea, constipation, or diarrhea)

Bladder or bowel dysfunction

Sexual dysfunction

Drop in blood pressure when standing (dizziness or fainting)

Unnoticed injuries on the feet due to numbness, which can lead to infections

How to Prevent or Delay Diabetic Nerve Damage:
Keep blood sugar levels in target range as advised by your healthcare provider

Manage blood pressure and cholesterol

Avoid smoking and limit alcohol intake

Maintain a healthy diet and regular physical activity

Inspect feet daily for blisters, cuts, or sores

Attend regular checkups and report any symptoms early

Would you like guidance on a prevention plan or details about specific types of diabetic neuropathy?","Diabetes can cause several problems in the nervous system, which can manifest in different ways. Here are some symptoms related to diabetes-related nervous system problems:

1. Neuropathy: This is a common complication of diabetes, which can cause numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands, arms, feet, and legs.

2. Gastroparesis: Diabetes can affect the vagus nerve, which controls the stomach muscles. This can lead to symptoms like nausea, vomiting, bloating, lack of appetite, and persistent feeling of fullness.

3. Autonomic Neuropathy: This can affect various organs and bodily functions like heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, digestion, and sexual function. 

4. Peripheral Neuropathy: This is characterized by pain, numbness, or tingling in the extremities like hands and feet.

5. Mononeuropathy: This involves damage to a specific nerve and may cause severe pain in the face, thigh, or abdomen. It may also cause double vision or difficulties in focusing the eyes.

6. Urinary Tract Problems: Diabetes can affect nerves that control the bladder, leading to symptoms like frequent urination, urinary incontinence, and urinary tract infections. 

7. Sexual Dysfunction: In men, diabetes can lead to erectile dysfunction, while women may experience vaginal dryness or lack of arousal.

8. Hypoglycemia Unawareness: Diabetes can cause low blood sugar without the typical warning signs, making it dangerous for the individual.

- nausea   - vomiting   - diarrhea   - low blood pressure that drops further when a person stands up, causing dizziness or fainting   - irritability and depression   - craving salty foods   - hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar   - headache   - sweating   - irregular or absent menstrual periods   - in women, loss of interest in sex
                
Hyperpigmentation, or darkening of the skin, can occur in Addisons disease, although not in secondary adrenal insufficiency. This darkening is most visible on scars; skin folds; pressure points such as the elbows, knees, knuckles, and toes; lips; and mucous membranes such as the lining of the cheek.
                
The slowly progressing symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are often ignored until a stressful event, such as surgery, a severe injury, an illness, or pregnancy, causes them to worsen.
                
Adrenal Crisis
                
Sudden, severe worsening of adrenal insufficiency symptoms is called adrenal crisis. If the person has Addisons disease, this worsening can also be called an Addisonian crisis. In most cases, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency become serious enough that people seek medical treatment before an adrenal crisis occurs. However, sometimes symptoms appear for the first time during an adrenal crisis.
                
Symptoms of adrenal crisis include
                
- sudden, severe pain in the lower back, abdomen, or legs   - severe vomiting and diarrhea   - dehydration   - low blood pressure   - loss of consciousness
                
If not treated, an adrenal crisis can cause death.
                

                
Get Treatment for Adrenal Crisis Right Away   People with adrenal insufficiency who have weakness, nausea, or vomiting need immediate emergency treatment to prevent an adrenal crisis and possible death. An injection with a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone called a corticosteroid can save a persons life. People should make sure to have a corticosteroid injection with them at all times, and make sure their friends and family know how and when to give the injection.   Read more under How is adrenal insufficiency treated?","Adrenal insufficiency, including Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency), occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones—primarily cortisol, and in Addison’s disease, also aldosterone. These hormones are essential for regulating metabolism, blood pressure, and the body’s response to stress.

Common Symptoms of Adrenal Insufficiency (Including Addison’s Disease):
Persistent fatigue or muscle weakness

Weight loss and decreased appetite

Nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain

Low blood pressure, especially when standing (can cause dizziness or fainting)

Salt cravings

Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)

Irritability or depression

Joint or muscle pain

Darkening of the skin (hyperpigmentation), especially in Addison’s disease

Dehydration

Addisonian Crisis (Acute Adrenal Failure – a medical emergency):
Severe vomiting and diarrhea

Extremely low blood pressure (shock)

Confusion, restlessness, or loss of consciousness

Severe muscle weakness

Pain in lower back, abdomen, or legs

High fever

This condition requires immediate medical attention, as it can be life-threatening if not treated promptly with corticosteroids and fluids.

Causes:
Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease): Usually caused by autoimmune destruction of the adrenal glands

Secondary adrenal insufficiency: Often due to pituitary gland disorders or long-term use of corticosteroid medications

Note: These symptoms can develop gradually and may be mistaken for other conditions, which is why adrenal insufficiency is sometimes difficult to diagnose early.

Many people with type 2 diabetes experience mild or no symptoms in the early stages, which can lead to delayed diagnosis.

Common Symptoms of Type 2 Diabetes:
Increased thirst (polydipsia)
A frequent urge to drink water due to excess sugar in the bloodstream pulling fluid from tissues.

Frequent urination (polyuria)
Particularly noticeable at night, as the kidneys try to eliminate excess glucose.

Increased hunger (polyphagia)
Even after eating, due to cells not receiving enough glucose for energy.

Fatigue
A persistent feeling of tiredness or lack of energy, even with adequate rest.

Blurred vision
Caused by fluctuations in fluid levels and glucose affecting the eye’s lenses.

Slow-healing sores or frequent infections
Especially on the skin, gums, or feet, due to impaired immune response.

Numbness or tingling in hands or feet
A potential sign of diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage).

Unintended weight loss
Less common than in type 1 diabetes but can occur in advanced or uncontrolled cases.

Darkened skin in body folds (acanthosis nigricans)
Typically in areas like the neck, armpits, or groin, indicating insulin resistance.

Dark patches may also appear on elbows, knees, knuckles, and armpits. This condition is called acanthosis nigricans.","Insulin resistance and prediabetes are closely related conditions that develop gradually and often without obvious symptoms. Many people may not know they have either condition until routine blood work reveals abnormal glucose levels.

What is Insulin Resistance?
Insulin resistance occurs when the body’s cells don’t respond properly to insulin, a hormone that helps glucose enter cells for energy. As a result, the pancreas produces more insulin to compensate. Over time, this can lead to prediabetes and eventually type 2 diabetes if not managed.

Symptoms of Insulin Resistance:
Insulin resistance itself often has no clear symptoms, but certain signs and associated conditions may indicate its presence:

Increased hunger, especially after meals

Fatigue or low energy levels

Difficulty losing weight, particularly around the abdomen

Frequent cravings for carbohydrates or sugary foods

Dark patches of skin (acanthosis nigricans) – often on the neck, armpits, elbows, or knees

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in women – linked to insulin resistance

Elevated blood pressure and cholesterol levels – part of metabolic syndrome

What is Prediabetes?
Prediabetes is a condition where blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diabetes diagnosis. It often develops from prolonged insulin resistance.

Symptoms of Prediabetes:
Like insulin resistance, prediabetes often has no noticeable symptoms. However, some people may experience:

Increased thirst

Frequent urination

Blurred vision

Fatigue

Unexplained weight gain or difficulty losing weight

These symptoms may mimic early signs of type 2 diabetes. However, many individuals with prediabetes remain asymptomatic.

Risk Factors to Watch For:
Age over 45

Overweight or obesity (especially central obesity)

Sedentary lifestyle

Family history of type 2 diabetes

History of gestational diabetes

High blood pressure or abnormal cholesterol levels

Important Reminder: This information is for educational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice. If you’re concerned about insulin resistance or prediabetes, it’s important to consult a healthcare provider for proper testing and personalized recommendations.

Would you like help understanding which preventive services or screenings are typically covered under health insurance for insulin resistance or prediabetes?","1. Increased Thirst: People with insulin resistance or prediabetes often feel thirsty and have a dry mouth.

2. Frequent Urination: With high blood sugar levels, the kidneys work hard to get rid of excess sugar, resulting in frequent urination.

3. Constant Hunger: Despite eating, the body's cells may not get enough glucose, causing constant hunger.

4. Weight Gain: Despite eating the same or less, insulin resistance can cause weight gain.

5. Fatigue: With cells not getting enough glucose, the body may feel tired and lethargic.

6. Blurred Vision: High blood sugar levels can cause fluid to be pulled from the lenses of your eyes, causing blurred vision.

7. Dark Skin Patches: Insulin resistance can cause dark patches on the neck and under the arms.

8. Slow Healing: Wounds and sores may take longer to heal. 

9. Frequent Infections: Insulin resistance can weaken the immune system, leading to frequent infections.

10. Tingling or Numbness: High blood sugar levels can affect blood circulation and damage nerves, leading to tingling or numbness in hands and feet.

It's important to note that many people with insulin resistance or prediabetes have no symptoms. Regular check-ups and blood tests are necessary for early detection and management.",9.0,7.5,6.84,6.09
symptoms,What are the symptoms of Amyloidosis and Kidney Disease ?,"The most common sign of primary amyloidosis of the kidneys is nephrotic syndromea collection of signs that indicate kidney damage. The signs of nephrotic syndrome include
                
- albuminuriaan increased amount of albumin, a protein, in the urine. A person with nephrotic syndrome excretes more than half a teaspoon of albumin per day.  - hyperlipidemiaa condition in which a persons blood has more-than-normal amounts of fats and cholesterol.  - edemaswelling, typically in a persons legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face.  - hypoalbuminemiaa condition in which a persons blood has less-than-normal amounts of albumin.
                
More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Nephrotic Syndrome in Adults.
                
Other signs and symptoms of primary amyloidosis may include
                
- fatigue, or feeling tired  - shortness of breath  - low blood pressure  - numbness, tingling, or a burning sensation in the hands or feet  - weight loss","Amyloidosis – Symptoms
Amyloidosis is a rare condition caused by the buildup of an abnormal protein called amyloid in organs and tissues, disrupting normal function. It can affect multiple organs, including the kidneys, heart, liver, and nervous system.

General Symptoms (Systemic Amyloidosis):
Fatigue

Unexplained weight loss

Swelling (edema) in the legs, ankles, or abdomen

Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet (peripheral neuropathy)

Shortness of breath

Irregular heartbeat

Enlarged tongue (macroglossia)

Easy bruising, especially around the eyes (periorbital purpura)

When the Kidneys Are Affected:
Protein in the urine (proteinuria) – may cause frothy urine

Swelling (edema) – especially in legs and feet, due to loss of protein

Decreased kidney function or signs of chronic kidney disease

High blood pressure (in some cases)

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) – Symptoms
CKD is a progressive loss of kidney function over time. In early stages, it often has no symptoms. Symptoms usually appear when kidney function is significantly impaired.

Early-Stage Symptoms (often subtle):
Fatigue and weakness

Trouble concentrating

Poor appetite

Difficulty sleeping

Dry, itchy skin

Frequent urination, especially at night

Later-Stage or Advanced Symptoms:
Swelling (edema) in ankles, feet, or face

Changes in urination – more or less frequent, dark-colored, or foamy urine

Shortness of breath – from fluid buildup or anemia

Nausea and vomiting

Muscle cramps or twitches

Persistent itching

Chest pain if fluid builds up around the heart

High blood pressure that’s hard to control

Important Distinction and Connection:
Amyloidosis can cause kidney disease when amyloid deposits damage kidney tissues, leading to nephrotic syndrome or progressive renal failure. This overlap means symptoms may coexist or be mistakenly attributed to one or the other.

Reminder: This information is not medical advice. If you suspect symptoms of amyloidosis or kidney disease, consult a healthcare provider promptly for testing and diagnosis.

Would you like assistance understanding how health plans typically cover evaluation and treatment for these conditions, such as lab tests, biopsies, or specialist visits?","Amyloidosis is a rare disease that occurs when a substance called amyloid builds up in your organs. The symptoms can vary widely, depending on which organs are affected. However, some of the common symptoms may include:

1. Swelling of your ankles and legs
2. Severe fatigue and weakness
3. Shortness of breath
4. Numbness, tingling, or pain in your hands or feet
5. Diarrhea, constipation or feeling full quickly
6. Unintentional weight loss
7. An enlarged tongue (macroglossia)
8. Skin changes, such as thickening or easy bruising
9. Purple patches around the eyes

Kidney disease, also known as renal disease, is a condition that affects the kidneys. The symptoms often don't appear until the disease is advanced. Common symptoms of kidney disease include:

1. Nausea
2. Vomiting
3. Loss of appetite
4. Fatigue and weakness
5. Sleep problems
6. Changes in urine output (more or less than usual)

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Amyloidosis and Kidney Disease ?,"The symptoms of dialysis-related amyloidosis may include
                
- pain, stiffness, and fluid in the joints.  - abnormal, fluid-containing sacs, called cysts, in some bones.  - carpal tunnel syndrome, caused by unusual buildup of amyloid proteins in the wrists. The symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include numbness or tingling, sometimes associated with muscle weakness, in the fingers and hands.
                
Dialysis-related amyloidosis most often affects bones, joints, and the tissues that connect muscle to bone, called tendons. The disease may also affect the digestive tract and organs such as the heart and lungs. Bone cysts caused by dialysis-related amyloidosis can lead to bone fractures. Dialysis-related amyloidosis can also cause tears in tendons and ligaments. Ligaments are tissues that connect bones to other bones.","Here’s a clear breakdown of the symptoms of amyloidosis and kidney disease, both of which can present with overlapping signs—especially when amyloid deposits affect the kidneys.

Amyloidosis – Symptoms
Amyloidosis is a condition caused by abnormal protein (amyloid) deposits in organs and tissues, disrupting their function. The symptoms depend on which organs are involved.

General (Systemic) Symptoms:
Fatigue

Unexplained weight loss

Swelling in the legs, feet, or abdomen (edema)

Numbness or tingling in hands or feet (neuropathy)

Enlarged tongue (macroglossia), may cause speech or swallowing issues

Easy bruising, especially around the eyes (periorbital purpura)

Shortness of breath

Irregular heartbeat (if the heart is involved)

Kidney Involvement in Amyloidosis:
When amyloid deposits build up in the kidneys, they impair the kidneys' filtering ability, often leading to:

Protein in the urine (proteinuria) — can make urine appear foamy

Swelling in the lower legs, ankles, or around the eyes

Decreased kidney function or chronic kidney disease

High blood pressure in some cases

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) – Symptoms
Chronic Kidney Disease is a gradual loss of kidney function over time. Many symptoms develop gradually, especially in the early stages.

Early-Stage Symptoms (Often Mild or Absent):
Fatigue

Difficulty concentrating

Poor appetite

Trouble sleeping

Dry, itchy skin

Increased urination at night (nocturia)

Advanced or Later-Stage Symptoms:
Swelling in feet, ankles, hands, or face (due to fluid retention)

Nausea and vomiting

Muscle cramps or twitching

Shortness of breath (due to fluid in the lungs or anemia)

Changes in urine output or appearance (dark or foamy urine)

Persistent itching

High blood pressure that’s difficult to manage

Overlap and Connection:
Amyloidosis can lead to kidney disease when amyloid deposits impair kidney function. In such cases, symptoms of both conditions may occur simultaneously, making diagnosis more complex.

Note: This information is educational and not a substitute for medical advice. If you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, it’s important to consult a healthcare provider for proper testing and diagnosis.

9. Diarrhea, possibly with blood, or constipation
10. Numbness, tingling or pain in hands or feet, particularly pain in wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome)

Kidney Disease Symptoms:
1. Changes in urination — making more or less urine than usual, feeling pressure when urinating, changes in the color of urine, foamy or bubbly urine, or having to get up at night to urinate.
2. Swelling of the feet, ankles, hands, or face — fluid the kidneys can’t remove may stay in the tissues.
3. Fatigue or weakness — a build-up of wastes or a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) can cause these problems when the kidneys begin to fail.
4. Shortness of breath — kidney disease can cause fluid to build up in the lungs. And also, anemia (a shortage of oxygen-carrying red blood cells) can leave your body oxygen-starved and short of breath.
5. Ammonia breath or an ammonia or metal taste in the mouth— waste build-up in the body can cause bad breath, changes in taste, or an aversion to protein foods like meat.
6. Back or flank pain — the kidneys are located on either side of the spine in the back.
7. Itching — waste build-up in the body can cause severe itching, especially of the legs.

- fevers and chills  - nausea or vomiting  - a change in bowel habitsconstipation or diarrhea  - diverticular bleeding
                
In most cases, people with diverticular bleeding suddenly have a large amount of red or maroon-colored blood in their stool. Diverticular bleeding may also cause
                
- weakness  - dizziness or light-headedness  - abdominal cramping","Diverticular disease refers to a group of conditions that involve diverticula—small, bulging pouches that can form in the lining of the digestive system, most often in the colon (large intestine). It includes diverticulosis, diverticulitis, and related complications.

1. Diverticulosis – Symptoms
This is the presence of diverticula without inflammation or infection.
It is usually asymptomatic, especially in the early stages.

Possible Symptoms (if present):
Mild cramping or discomfort in the lower abdomen (typically on the left side)

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea)

Most people with diverticulosis are unaware they have it unless it's found incidentally during imaging or a colonoscopy.

2. Diverticulitis – Symptoms
Diverticulitis occurs when one or more diverticula become inflamed or infected.

Common Symptoms:
Persistent abdominal pain, usually on the lower left side

Fever and chills

Nausea and vomiting

Constipation or sometimes diarrhea

Abdominal tenderness

Bloating

Loss of appetite

Severe or Complicated Diverticulitis:
May include symptoms such as:

Severe or worsening abdominal pain

High fever

Blood in the stool or rectal bleeding

Signs of peritonitis (rigid abdomen, severe pain) in case of rupture

Possible abscess, fistula, or bowel obstruction

These require immediate medical evaluation.

3. Diverticular Bleeding – Symptoms
Sometimes, a diverticulum may erode into a blood vessel and cause bleeding.

Signs include:
Sudden passage of bright red or maroon blood from the rectum

Lightheadedness or dizziness (in cases of significant blood loss)

Usually painless

Over time, the condition can cause malnutrition, bacterial overgrowth in the intestines, and weight loss. Malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function.
                
Some people develop problems with their esophagus, stomach, or bladder.","Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a rare condition that mimics the symptoms of a physical blockage (obstruction) in the intestines but without any actual mechanical blockage. It results from problems with the muscles or nerves that control intestinal movement (motility).

This condition can be either acute or chronic and may affect either the small intestine, large intestine, or both.

Symptoms of Intestinal Pseudo-obstruction
The symptoms are very similar to those of a true intestinal obstruction and can vary in severity depending on the underlying cause and extent of intestinal involvement.

Gastrointestinal Symptoms:
Abdominal pain or cramping

Abdominal bloating or distension

Nausea and vomiting

Constipation or infrequent bowel movements

Diarrhea (less common but can occur, especially early on)

Feeling of fullness after eating small amounts (early satiety)

Loss of appetite

Additional Signs in Chronic Cases:
Weight loss due to poor nutrient absorption or fear of eating

Malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances

Symptoms of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) such as gas, bloating, and foul-smelling stool

Weakness or fatigue

Potential Causes:
Intestinal pseudo-obstruction may be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to other conditions. Causes can include:

Neuromuscular diseases (e.g., muscular dystrophy, Parkinson’s disease)

Autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic sclerosis)

Metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetes)

Infections

Certain medications (especially opioids and anticholinergics)

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Acromegaly ?,"The name acromegaly comes from the Greek words for ""extremities"" and ""enlargement,"" reflecting one of its most common symptomsthe abnormal growth of the hands and feet. Swelling of the hands and feet is often an early feature, with patients noticing a change in ring or shoe size, particularly shoe width. Gradually, bone changes alter the patient's facial features: The brow and lower jaw protrude, the nasal bone enlarges, and the teeth space out.
                
Overgrowth of bone and cartilage often leads to arthritis. When tissue thickens, it may trap nerves, causing carpal tunnel syndrome, which results in numbness and weakness of the hands. Body organs, including the heart, may enlarge.
                
Other symptoms of acromegaly include
                
- joint aches  - thick, coarse, oily skin  - skin tags  - enlarged lips, nose, and tongue  - deepening of the voice due to enlarged sinuses and vocal cords  - sleep apnea-breaks in breathing during sleep due to obstruction of the airway  - excessive sweating and skin odor  - fatigue and weakness  - headaches  - impaired vision  - abnormalities of the menstrual cycle and sometimes breast discharge in women  - erectile dysfunction in men  - decreased libido","Acromegaly is a rare hormonal disorder that results from excess growth hormone (GH), usually due to a noncancerous tumor of the pituitary gland (pituitary adenoma). It develops gradually, often over several years, and may go undiagnosed for a long time due to the slow progression of symptoms.

Symptoms of Acromegaly
The symptoms can vary but are generally related to the enlargement of bones and soft tissues, as well as systemic effects of excess growth hormone.

Physical Changes:
Enlarged hands and feet

Rings may no longer fit; shoe size may increase.

Facial changes

Enlarged nose, lips, tongue, and jaw (prognathism)

Widened spacing of teeth

Coarsening of facial features

Thickened skin

Oily or coarse skin texture

Musculoskeletal Symptoms:
Joint pain and stiffness

Arthritis

Carpal tunnel syndrome (numbness/tingling in hands)

Organ and Tissue Enlargement:
Enlarged heart (cardiomegaly) – may lead to heart problems

Enlarged liver, kidneys, or other organs

Swelling in soft tissues – such as the tongue (macroglossia)

Metabolic and Systemic Symptoms:
Excessive sweating

Fatigue

Headaches

Vision problems – especially peripheral vision loss, if the tumor compresses the optic nerves

Sleep apnea – due to airway obstruction from enlarged tissues

Menstrual irregularities in women

Erectile dysfunction in men

Insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes

When to Seek Medical Evaluation:
Because acromegaly progresses slowly, it can be missed until changes become more pronounced. If you notice unexplained changes in facial features, hand/foot size, or experience persistent joint pain, it’s important to consult a healthcare provider.

Enlarged hands and feet: This is often one of the first noticeable signs of acromegaly. Rings may not fit anymore, and shoe size can increase.

2. Coarsened facial features: Changes in the face may include a protruding jaw and brow, enlarged nose, thickened lips, and wider spacing between the teeth.

3. Joint pain: Due to the effect of growth hormone on the bones and joints, a person with acromegaly may suffer from joint pain.

4. Thickened skin: The skin may become rough and thick, particularly around the knuckles and finger joints.

5. Excessive sweating and body odor: Increased sweat and body odor are common symptoms of acromegaly.

6. Fatigue and muscle weakness: Despite increased muscle mass, individuals with acromegaly often feel weak and tired.

7. Enlarged sebaceous glands: This can lead to skin conditions such as acne or excessively oily skin.

8. Menstrual cycle irregularities in women: High levels of growth hormone can interfere with ovulation and menstrual cycles.

9. Erectile dysfunction in men: This may be due to the effects of excess growth hormone on the body's hormonal balance.

10. Sleep apnea: Enlarged tissues in the mouth and throat can cause breathing problems during sleep.

11. Vision problems: If the pituitary tumor compresses the optic nerve, vision problems may occur.

- feel tired or weak  - lose your appetite  - feel sick to your stomach  - lose weight  - notice red, spider-shaped blood vessels under your skin
                
Cirrhosis can lead to other serious problems:
                
- You may bruise or bleed easily, or have nosebleeds.  - Bloating or swelling may occur as fluid builds up in your legs or abdomenthe area between your chest and hips. Fluid buildup in your legs is called edema; buildup in your abdomen is called ascites.  - Medicines, including those you can buy over the counter such as vitamins and herbal supplements, may have a stronger effect on you. Your liver does not break medicines down as quickly as a healthy liver would.   - Waste materials from food may build up in your blood or brain and cause confusion or difficulty thinking.   - Blood pressure may increase in the vein entering your liver, a condition called portal hypertension.   - Enlarged veins, called varices, may develop in your esophagus and stomach. Varices can bleed suddenly, causing you to throw up blood or pass blood in a bowel movement.   - Your kidneys may not work properly or may fail.   - Your skin and the whites of your eyes may turn yellow, a condition called jaundice.   - You may develop severe itching.   - You may develop gallstones.
                
In the early stages, cirrhosis causes your liver to swell. Then, as more scar tissue replaces healthy tissue, your liver shrinks.
                
A small number of people with cirrhosis also get liver cancer.","What Is Cirrhosis?
Cirrhosis is a late stage of scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by long-term liver damage. As healthy liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue, liver function progressively declines.

Cirrhosis is irreversible, but early diagnosis and management can slow or prevent further liver damage.

Common Causes of Cirrhosis:
Chronic alcohol use

Chronic viral hepatitis (Hepatitis B and C)

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)

Autoimmune liver diseases (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis)

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Gallstones ?,"Many people with gallstones do not have symptoms. Gallstones that do not cause symptoms are called asymptomatic, or silent, gallstones. Silent gallstones do not interfere with the function of the gallbladder, liver, or pancreas.
                
If gallstones block the bile ducts, pressure increases in the gallbladder, causing a gallbladder attack. The pain usually lasts from 1 to several hours.1 Gallbladder attacks often follow heavy meals, and they usually occur in the evening or during the night.
                
Gallbladder attacks usually stop when gallstones move and no longer block the bile ducts. However, if any of the bile ducts remain blocked for more than a few hours, complications can occur. Complications include infl ammation, or swelling, of the gallbladder and severe damage or infection of the gallbladder, bile ducts, or liver.
                
A gallstone that becomes lodged in the common bile duct near the duodenum and blocks the pancreatic duct can cause gallstone pancreatitisin flammation of the pancreas.
                
Left untreated, blockages of the bile ducts or pancreatic duct can be fatal.","Gallstones are solid particles that form in the gallbladder, a small organ beneath the liver that stores bile. Gallstones can range in size and may be asymptomatic or cause significant discomfort, depending on their size, number, and location.

Types of Gallstones:
Cholesterol gallstones (most common)

Pigment gallstones (made of excess bilirubin)

Symptoms of Gallstones
1. Asymptomatic (Silent Gallstones):
Many people with gallstones experience no symptoms.

These are often found incidentally during imaging for other reasons.

No treatment is usually required unless complications arise.

2. Symptomatic Gallstones:
When a gallstone blocks the flow of bile, symptoms can occur.

Typical Symptoms:
Biliary colic (gallbladder attack):

Sudden and intense pain in the upper right abdomen or center of the abdomen

Pain may radiate to the right shoulder or back

Often occurs after eating a fatty meal

Pain can last from 30 minutes to several hours

Nausea or vomiting

Bloating or indigestion

Intolerance to fatty foods

Burping or gas

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Microscopic Colitis: Collagenous Colitis and Lymphocytic Colitis ?,"The most common symptom of microscopic colitis is chronic, watery, nonbloody diarrhea. Episodes of diarrhea can last for weeks, months, or even years. However, many people with microscopic colitis may have long periods without diarrhea. Other signs and symptoms of microscopic colitis can include
                
- a strong urgency to have a bowel movement or a need to go to the bathroom quickly  - pain, cramping, or bloating in the abdomenthe area between the chest and the hipsthat is usually mild  - weight loss  - fecal incontinenceaccidental passing of stool or fluid from the rectumespecially at night  - nausea  - dehydrationa condition that results from not taking in enough liquids to replace fluids lost through diarrhea
                
The symptoms of microscopic colitis can come and go frequently. Sometimes, the symptoms go away without treatment.","Microscopic colitis is a form of chronic inflammation of the colon (large intestine) that is only visible under a microscope—hence the name. There are two main subtypes:

Collagenous colitis

Lymphocytic colitis

Both conditions cause similar symptoms and are classified under inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), though they are typically less severe than ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. They are more common in older adults, especially women.

Shared Symptoms of Microscopic Colitis (Both Types):
Chronic, watery diarrhea

Typically non-bloody

Can occur several times per day, even during the night

Abdominal pain or cramping

Bloating or gas

Urgency to have a bowel movement

Fecal incontinence (in some cases)

Weight loss (mild to moderate)

Fatigue

Symptoms may come and go or persist for weeks to months, and can sometimes be mistaken for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Differences Between the Two Types:
1. Collagenous Colitis
Characterized by a thickened layer of collagen (a protein) beneath the lining of the colon.

More common in middle-aged to older women.

Symptoms may be slightly more persistent or severe than lymphocytic colitis.

2. Lymphocytic Colitis
Characterized by an increased number of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) in the lining of the colon.

Affects men and women equally, often in their 40s to 60s.

Diagnosis:
Colonoscopy usually appears normal.

Biopsy of colon tissue is required to confirm the diagnosis, showing the microscopic changes that define each subtype.

Associated Conditions:
Microscopic colitis may occur alongside:

Autoimmune disorders (e.g., celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disorders)

Use of certain medications (e.g., NSAIDs, PPIs, SSRIs)

Note: This information is for educational purposes only and not a substitute for medical advice. If you are experiencing persistent or unexplained diarrhea, it's important to consult a healthcare provider for evaluation and diagnosis.

3. Abdominal pain or cramps: This can vary from mild to severe.

4. Nausea: Some people may feel nauseated or even vomit.

5. Dehydration: Chronic diarrhea can lead to dehydration.

6. Bloating: This is a feeling of fullness or swelling in the abdomen.

7. Increased frequency of bowel movements: More than normal bowel movements in a day.

8. Fecal incontinence: This is a loss of bowel control.

9. Fatigue: This is due to the loss of nutrients from the body.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of What I need to know about Diverticular Disease ?,"The symptoms for diverticulosis and diverticulitis are different.
                
Diverticulosis. Many people don't have symptoms, but some people have cramping, bloating, and constipation. Some people also have bleeding, inflammation, and fistulas. If you are bleeding, bright red blood will pass through your rectum. The rectum is the end of the colon that connects to the anus. The rectum and anus are part of the gastrointestinal tract, which is the passage that food goes through. Rectal bleeding is usually painless, but it can be dangerous. You should see a doctor right away.
                
Diverticulitis. People with diverticulitis can have many symptoms. Often pain is felt in the lower part of the abdomen. If you have diverticulitis, you may have fevers, feel sick to your stomach, vomit, or have a change in your bowel habits.","Diverticular disease refers to conditions that involve diverticula—small pouches that form in the wall of the colon. It includes:

Diverticulosis – presence of diverticula without symptoms

Diverticulitis – inflammation or infection of the diverticula

Diverticular bleeding – bleeding from a diverticulum

Diverticula are more common after age 40 and are often linked to low-fiber diets.

Symptoms of Diverticular Disease
1. Diverticulosis (Uncomplicated Diverticula)
Often no symptoms

Occasionally mild:

Abdominal bloating

Cramping or discomfort (usually in the lower left abdomen)

Irregular bowel movements (constipation or diarrhea)

2. Diverticulitis (Inflamed/Infected Diverticula)
Symptoms are more severe and require medical attention:

Persistent pain in the lower left abdomen

Fever and chills

Nausea and vomiting

Constipation or, less commonly, diarrhea

Abdominal tenderness or swelling

Loss of appetite

3. Complicated Diverticulitis
Involves more serious outcomes:

Abscess formation

Perforation (tear in the colon wall)

Peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal lining)

Bowel obstruction

Requires emergency care

4. Diverticular Bleeding
Sudden, painless rectal bleeding

Bright red or maroon-colored blood in the stool

Dizziness or weakness if bleeding is heavy

Usually stops on its own but may require hospitalization

Risk Factors:
Aging

Low-fiber diet

Obesity

Physical inactivity

Smoking

Use of NSAIDs or steroids

Key Takeaways:
Most people with diverticulosis never develop symptoms.

Diverticulitis can become serious if untreated.

A high-fiber diet and regular physical activity may help prevent flare-ups.

Diagnosis typically involves CT scans, colonoscopy, or other imaging tests.

Treatment depends on severity and ranges from dietary changes and antibiotics to surgery.

Note: This information is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. If you're experiencing abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or digestive issues, consult a healthcare provider for evaluation and management.

Would you like to know how insurance typically covers tests or treatments for diverticular disease, such as CT scans or outpatient procedures?","Diverticular disease generally consists of two conditions: diverticulosis and diverticulitis. 

Diverticulosis may often be asymptomatic, but some people may experience mild symptoms including:

1. Bloating and gas
2. Cramps or discomfort in the lower abdomen, particularly on the left side
3. Changes in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea)

Diverticulitis, a more serious condition that occurs when the diverticula become infected or inflamed, can cause symptoms such as:

symptoms,What are the symptoms of What I need to know about Hirschsprung Disease ?,"The main symptoms of HD are constipation or intestinal obstruction, usually appearing shortly after birth. Constipation in infants and children is common and usually comes and goes, but if your child has had ongoing constipation since birth, HD may be the problem.
                
Symptoms in Newborns
                
Newborns with HD almost always fail to have their first bowel movement within 48 hours after birth. Other symptoms include
                
- green or brown vomit  - explosive stools after a doctor inserts a finger into the rectum  - swelling of the belly, also known as the abdomen  - lots of gas  - bloody diarrhea
                

                
Symptoms in Toddlers and Older Children
                
Symptoms of HD in toddlers and older children include
                
- not being able to pass stools without laxatives or enemas. A laxative is medicine that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. An enema is performed by flushing water, or sometimes a mild soap solution, into the anus using a special wash bottle.  - swelling of the abdomen.  - lots of gas.  - bloody diarrhea.  - slow growth or development.  - lack of energy because of a shortage of red blood cells, called anemia.","Hirschsprung disease is a congenital condition (present at birth) in which nerve cells (ganglion cells) are missing from parts of the intestine, usually the colon. These nerve cells are necessary for muscles in the bowel to contract and move stool. Without them, affected segments cannot properly push stool forward, leading to a blockage.

It most often affects infants and young children, but in rare cases, it may be diagnosed later in life.

Symptoms of Hirschsprung Disease
In Newborns:
Failure to pass meconium (the first stool) within 24–48 hours after birth

Swollen belly (abdominal distension)

Vomiting – may be green or brown (bilious)

Constipation

Reluctance to feed or poor feeding

Explosive bowel movements after a rectal exam

In Infants and Older Children:
Chronic constipation

Abdominal bloating

Poor growth or failure to thrive

Vomiting

Fatigue or irritability

Ribbon-like or foul-smelling stools

In Severe Cases (Enterocolitis):
This is a serious, life-threatening complication.

Fever

Severe diarrhea

Bloody stool

Lethargy

Signs of dehydration or shock

Causes and Risk Factors:
Occurs due to incomplete development of nerve cells in the bowel during fetal development

More common in boys than girls

Associated with genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome

Can be inherited in families

Diagnosis:
Abdominal X-ray or contrast enema

Rectal biopsy to confirm absence of nerve cells

Anorectal manometry (in older children)

Treatment:
Surgical removal of the segment without nerve cells (pull-through surgery)

In some cases, a temporary colostomy may be needed before corrective surgery

Long-Term Outlook:
Most children do well after surgery, though some may continue to have:

Occasional constipation

Bowel control issues

Intestinal infections (rare)

Note: This overview is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. Hirschsprung disease requires evaluation and treatment by a pediatric surgeon or gastroenterologist. If a newborn or child shows symptoms, especially delayed passage of stool or significant constipation, seek medical care promptly.

- blood in their urine  - symptoms of infection, such as fever, lethargy, irritability, or abdominal pain  - loss of appetite  - diarrhea  - high blood pressure","Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome is a kidney disorder seen in children, typically between the ages of 2 and 6, that causes the body to leak large amounts of protein into the urine. This leads to swelling and other systemic symptoms. It’s often due to minimal change disease, a condition where the kidneys look normal under a regular microscope but function abnormally.

Key Symptoms of Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome
1. Swelling (Edema):
Often the first and most noticeable sign

Begins around the eyes (periorbital edema), especially in the morning

May progress to the ankles, feet, legs, or abdomen (ascites)

In more severe cases, swelling can affect the entire body

2. Frothy or Foamy Urine:
Due to high levels of protein in the urine (proteinuria)

3. Decreased Urine Output:
Urination may become less frequent

Urine may appear darker

4. Weight Gain:
Due to fluid retention rather than increased fat or muscle

5. Fatigue or Irritability:
Caused by fluid imbalance and underlying kidney dysfunction

6. Loss of Appetite or Nausea:
Common during relapses or when swelling is severe

7. Infections:
Children with nephrotic syndrome may be more prone to infections (e.g., peritonitis, cellulitis) due to loss of protective proteins

8. High Cholesterol or Triglycerides (found on blood tests):
The liver increases production of cholesterol in response to low protein levels

Causes of Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome:
Minimal Change Disease (MCD) – most common cause in children

Less commonly:

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)

Genetic or secondary causes (e.g., infections, autoimmune conditions)

When to Seek Medical Attention:
Sudden or worsening swelling

Decreased urination

Fever or signs of infection

Difficulty breathing (due to fluid buildup in the lungs)

Poor feeding or persistent fatigue

Note: This condition is typically diagnosed with urine and blood tests, and sometimes a kidney biopsy if the cause is unclear or the child doesn’t respond to treatment.

3. Foamy or frothy urine: The urine may look foamy due to the excess protein.

4. Poor appetite: Children may not feel like eating.

5. Fatigue: Children may feel tired or sluggish because their body is working hard to deal with the excess fluid and protein loss.

6. Frequent infections: Children with nephrotic syndrome have a higher risk of infections because of changes in the immune system.

7. High cholesterol: High levels of cholesterol and other fats in the blood are common in nephrotic syndrome.

8. Low levels of protein in the blood: This is due to protein loss in the urine.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Hepatitis B: What Asian and Pacific Islander Americans Need to Know ?,"Hepatitis B is called a silent killer because many people have no symptoms, so the disease often progresses unnoticed for years. Unfortunately, many people first learn they have chronic hepatitis B when they develop symptoms of severe liver damage, which include
                
- yellowish eyes and skin, called jaundice  - a swollen stomach or ankles  - tiredness  - nausea  - weakness  - loss of appetite  - weight loss  - spiderlike blood vessels, called spider angiomas, that develop on the skin","Hepatitis B is a viral infection that affects the liver. It can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-lasting), and if left untreated, it can lead to serious liver complications such as cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer.

Why It Matters for Asian and Pacific Islander Americans:
Asian and Pacific Islander Americans account for more than 50% of chronic hepatitis B cases in the U.S., despite making up about 6% of the population.

Many people in these communities were infected at birth or in early childhood, often unknowingly.

Chronic infection may persist for decades without symptoms, increasing the risk of late diagnosis and liver cancer.

Symptoms of Hepatitis B
Acute Hepatitis B:
Occurs shortly after infection (usually within 6 months).

Symptoms may include:

Fatigue

Loss of appetite

Nausea and vomiting

Abdominal pain, especially in the upper right side

Dark urine

Clay-colored or pale stools

Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)

Joint pain

Fever

Note: Some people, especially young children, may not show any symptoms during the acute phase.

Chronic Hepatitis B:
Persists for more than 6 months. It often causes no symptoms for many years, but silently damages the liver.

When symptoms appear, they may include:

Persistent tiredness

Right upper abdominal discomfort

Jaundice

Swelling in the legs or abdomen

Easy bruising or bleeding

Confusion or difficulty concentrating (a sign of advanced liver disease)

Key Points for Asian and Pacific Islander Americans:
Hepatitis B is often passed from mother to child at birth or during early childhood.

Adults can become infected through unprotected sex, sharing needles, or exposure to infected blood.

Screening is essential, even if you feel healthy—many people don’t know they’re infected.

Vaccination is safe and highly effective in preventing the disease.

Early detection can prevent liver cancer and cirrhosis.

What You Should Do:
Get tested if you were born in or have parents from a high-risk area (such as Asia or the Pacific Islands).

Get vaccinated if you're not already immune.

If you test positive, see a healthcare provider regularly to monitor your liver health.

Encourage family members to get tested and vaccinated.

Note: This information is educational and not a substitute for professional medical advice. Please consult a healthcare provider for screening, diagnosis, or treatment.

Would you like help understanding how hepatitis B testing, vaccination, and monitoring are typically covered under health insurance plans?","Hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by the Hepatitis B virus. It can lead to serious health issues, including liver damage, liver cancer, and even death.

1. Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
2. Fatigue or weakness
3. Loss of appetite
4. Nausea and vomiting
5. Abdominal pain, especially around your liver
6. Dark urine
7. Joint pain
8. Fever

However, many people with Hepatitis B do not experience any symptoms until the disease has already caused serious liver damage. This is why regular screening and early diagnosis are crucial, especially for high-risk groups such as Asian and Pacific Islander Americans.

Preventive measures include getting vaccinated, using protection during sex, and avoiding sharing needles or other drug paraphernalia. Pregnant women should also be tested for Hepatitis B to prevent passing the virus to their newborns.",8.5,8.5,7.54,7.07

Often due to enlarged kidneys or cyst rupture

May be dull or sharp, localized to the sides or lower back

2. Blood in the Urine (Hematuria):
Occurs if a cyst bleeds or ruptures

May appear as pink, red, or cola-colored urine

3. Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):
Less common but possible, especially if cysts become infected

4. Kidney Enlargement:
May feel a mass or fullness in the abdomen or flanks

5. Rare but Serious Complication – Kidney Cancer:
Small risk of renal cell carcinoma

May be suspected if cysts change rapidly, or if there's unexplained weight loss, persistent hematuria, or worsening kidney pain

Diagnosis:
Ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI to detect and monitor cysts

Routine imaging may be recommended for patients on long-term dialysis

Important Notes:
ACKD does not usually affect kidney function, which is already impaired in people with CKD or ESRD.

Management typically focuses on monitoring for complications.

No specific treatment is required for the cysts unless they cause symptoms or complications.

Reminder: This information is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as persistent kidney pain or blood in the urine should consult a healthcare provider promptly for evaluation.

Would you like help understanding how imaging and monitoring for ACKD are typically covered under health insurance, especially for individuals on dialysis?","Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease (ACKD) often doesn't cause any symptoms. However, if symptoms do occur, they may include:

1. Blood in the urine (hematuria)
2. Abdominal pain or tenderness
3. High blood pressure (hypertension)
4. Kidney stones
5. Frequent urination or feeling the need to urinate without being able to do so
6. Swelling of the hands and feet
7. Pain in the sides or back
8. Kidney infections
9. Kidney failure

It should be noted that these symptoms can also be caused by other medical conditions, so it's important to see a doctor for an accurate diagnosis. If a person has kidney failure, they may also have symptoms like nausea, fatigue, and loss of appetite.",7.5,9.0,6.93,7.38
symptoms,What are the symptoms of Prostate Enlargement: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ?,"Lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia may include
                
- urinary frequencyurination eight or more times a day  - urinary urgencythe inability to delay urination  - trouble starting a urine stream  - a weak or an interrupted urine stream  - dribbling at the end of urination  - nocturiafrequent urination during periods of sleep  - urinary retention  - urinary incontinencethe accidental loss of urine  - pain after ejaculation or during urination  - urine that has an unusual color or smell
                
Symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia most often come from
                
- a blocked urethra  - a bladder that is overworked from trying to pass urine through the blockage
                
The size of the prostate does not always determine the severity of the blockage or symptoms. Some men with greatly enlarged prostates have little blockage and few symptoms, while other men who have minimally enlarged prostates have greater blockage and more symptoms. Less than half of all men with benign prostatic hyperplasia have lower urinary tract symptoms.3
                
Sometimes men may not know they have a blockage until they cannot urinate. This condition, called acute urinary retention, can result from taking over-the-counter cold or allergy medications that contain decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine and oxymetazoline. A potential side effect of these medications may prevent the bladder neck from relaxing and releasing urine. Medications that contain antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, can weaken the contraction of bladder muscles and cause urinary retention, difficulty urinating, and painful urination. When men have partial urethra blockage, urinary retention also can occur as a result of alcohol consumption, cold temperatures, or a long period of inactivity.","Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)—also known as prostate gland enlargement—is a common, non-cancerous condition in older men. It involves the enlargement of the prostate gland, which surrounds the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body). As the prostate enlarges, it can press on the urethra and interfere with normal urination.

Symptoms of Prostate Enlargement (BPH)
The symptoms of BPH primarily affect urinary function and can vary in severity. They tend to worsen gradually over time.

Common Urinary Symptoms:
Frequent urination

Especially at night (nocturia)

Urgency to urinate

A sudden, strong urge to go, often hard to delay

Difficulty starting urination

Hesitancy or straining

Weak or interrupted urine stream

Reduced flow or dribbling

Incomplete bladder emptying

Feeling like the bladder is still full after urinating

Stopping and starting during urination

Dribbling at the end of urination

Less Common but Concerning Symptoms:
Urinary tract infections (UTIs)

Bladder stones

Blood in the urine (hematuria)

Inability to urinate (urinary retention) – this is a medical emergency

Risk Factors for BPH:
Age – most common in men over 50

Family history of prostate problems

Obesity and lack of physical activity

Chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease

When to See a Doctor:
If you experience persistent or bothersome urinary symptoms

If there’s blood in your urine, pain during urination, or inability to urinate

To rule out more serious conditions like prostate cancer

Note: This information is for educational purposes and not a substitute for medical advice. BPH can often be managed effectively with lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures. A healthcare provider can determine the best approach based on symptom severity and individual health status.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of What I need to know about My Child's Urinary Tract Infection ?,"A child with a UTI may not have any symptoms. When symptoms are present, they can range from mild to severe. UTI symptoms can include
                
- fever  - pain or burning during urination with only a few drops of urine at a time  - irritability  - not eating  - nausea  - diarrhea  - vomiting  - cloudy, dark, bloody, or foul-smelling urine  - urinating often  - pain in the back or side below the ribs  - leaking urine into clothes or bedding in older children","A UTI is an infection in any part of the urinary system—bladder, urethra, ureters, or kidneys. In children, UTIs are common and can happen at any age, but symptoms may be subtle or different compared to adults. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent complications like kidney damage.

Symptoms of UTIs in Children
Infants and Toddlers (Under 2 Years Old):
Fever without a known cause (often the only sign)

Irritability or fussiness

Poor feeding

Vomiting or diarrhea

Lethargy or decreased activity

Foul-smelling or cloudy urine

Failure to gain weight (in chronic cases)

Jaundice (in newborns)

Note: Babies and toddlers often don’t show the typical UTI symptoms seen in older children or adults.

Children (Age 2 and Up):
Pain or burning during urination

Frequent urge to urinate, even if little comes out

Bedwetting or daytime accidents in a previously potty-trained child

Urgency to urinate

Lower abdominal or back pain

Cloudy, foul-smelling, or bloody urine

Fever

Nausea or vomiting

When the Infection Affects the Kidneys (Pyelonephritis):
Symptoms are more severe and may include:

High fever (often over 101°F or 38.5°C)

Chills

Back or side pain

Vomiting

General ill feeling (malaise)

This type of UTI requires prompt medical treatment to avoid kidney damage.

What Causes UTIs in Children?
Bacteria entering the urethra, often from the skin or stool

Poor wiping technique (especially in girls)

Holding urine too long

Constipation

Structural problems in the urinary tract (in some cases)

What You Should Do:
See a doctor if your child has fever without a source, painful urination, or any concerning symptoms

Diagnosis usually involves a urine test (urinalysis and culture)

Antibiotics are typically prescribed, and symptoms often improve within 1–2 days

Follow up may include ultrasound or other imaging if UTIs are recurrent

Note: This information is for educational purposes and is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult your child’s healthcare provider if a UTI is suspected.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis ?,"The first and most common symptoms of primary biliary cirrhosis are
                
- fatigue, or feeling tired  - itching skin, and darkened skin in itching areas due to scratching  - dry eyes and mouth
                
Some people may have jaundice, a condition that causes the skin and whites of the eyes to turn yellow. Health care providers diagnose up to 60 percent of people with primary biliary cirrhosis before symptoms begin.2 Routine blood tests showing abnormal liver enzyme levels may lead a health care provider to suspect that a person without symptoms has primary biliary cirrhosis.","Primary Biliary Cirrhosis—now more accurately called Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)—is a chronic autoimmune liver disease. It involves gradual destruction of the small bile ducts inside the liver. This leads to bile buildup, liver inflammation, scarring (fibrosis), and potentially cirrhosis and liver failure over time.

It primarily affects middle-aged women, but it can occur in anyone.

Early Symptoms of Primary Biliary Cholangitis:
PBC often starts gradually, and symptoms may be mild or absent for years. Early detection is frequently based on abnormal liver tests before symptoms appear.

Common Early Symptoms:
Fatigue – persistent and often severe

Itching (pruritus) – often worse at night and without a visible rash

Dry eyes and dry mouth (sicca symptoms)

Right upper abdominal discomfort

Progressive Symptoms (As Liver Damage Advances):
Jaundice – yellowing of the skin and eyes

Dark urine

Pale or clay-colored stools

Swollen feet and ankles (edema)

Enlarged liver or spleen

Abdominal swelling due to fluid buildup (ascites)

Bone pain or fractures – from vitamin D malabsorption and osteoporosis

Hyperpigmentation – darkening of the skin, especially in sun-exposed areas

High cholesterol levels – particularly high HDL

Associated Autoimmune Conditions:
People with PBC may also have other autoimmune disorders, such as:

Sjögren’s syndrome

Thyroid disease

Rheumatoid arthritis

Scleroderma

When to Seek Medical Advice:
Persistent unexplained fatigue or itching

Abnormal liver function tests

Signs of cholestasis (reduced bile flow)

Diagnosis and Monitoring:
Blood tests: Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP), antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA), and liver enzymes

Imaging: Ultrasound to rule out other liver conditions

Liver biopsy (in some cases)

4. Abdominal pain: This can be present in the upper right part of the abdomen.

5. Jaundice: This is a yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes.

6. Darkening of the skin: This is not related to sun exposure.

7. Swelling of feet and ankles: This is due to fluid build-up in the legs.

8. Cholesterol deposits on the skin: These may appear as small, yellowish bumps on the skin.

9. Digestive problems: These can include bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.

- bloating, a feeling of fullness or swelling, in your belly  - pain in your belly  - diarrhea  - gas  - nausea
                
You may feel symptoms 30 minutes to 2 hours after you have milk or milk products. You may have mild or severe symptoms.","Lactose intolerance is the inability to fully digest lactose, the sugar found in milk and dairy products. It occurs when the body produces too little of the enzyme lactase, which is needed to break down lactose in the small intestine.

Lactose that isn’t digested moves into the colon, where it is fermented by bacteria, causing uncomfortable gastrointestinal symptoms.

Who Is Affected?
It can develop at any age, but often appears in adolescence or adulthood.

More common in people of Asian, African, Hispanic, and Native American descent.

Not the same as a milk allergy, which involves the immune system.

Symptoms of Lactose Intolerance
Symptoms usually appear 30 minutes to 2 hours after consuming lactose-containing foods or drinks.

Common Symptoms:
Bloating

Gas or flatulence

Stomach cramps or abdominal pain

Diarrhea

Nausea, sometimes with vomiting

Borborygmi (rumbling or gurgling stomach sounds)

The severity of symptoms can vary based on:

The amount of lactose consumed

The individual's level of lactase deficiency

The presence of other food in the stomach

Common Trigger Foods:
Milk (cow, goat)

Cheese (especially soft cheeses)

Ice cream

Yogurt (some types may be tolerated)

Cream-based sauces or soups

Processed foods containing whey, curds, or milk solids

Diagnosis:
Lactose hydrogen breath test (most common)

Lactose tolerance test

Elimination diet followed by reintroduction

Managing Lactose Intolerance:
Avoid or limit dairy products

Use lactose-free or lactose-reduced dairy alternatives

Take lactase enzyme supplements before eating dairy

Choose dairy foods that are naturally lower in lactose (e.g., hard cheeses, kefir, certain yogurts)

Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake from non-dairy sources or supplements

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Wilson Disease ?,"The signs and symptoms of Wilson disease vary, depending on what organs of the body are affected. Wilson disease is present at birth; however, the signs and symptoms of the disease do not appear until the copper builds up in the liver, the brain, or other organs.
                
When people have signs and symptoms, they usually affect the liver, the central nervous system, or both. The central nervous system includes the brain, the spinal cord, and nerves throughout the body. Sometimes a person does not have symptoms and a health care provider discovers the disease during a routine physical exam or blood test, or during an illness. Children can have Wilson disease for several years before any signs and symptoms occur. People with Wilson disease may have
                
- liver-related signs and symptoms  - central nervous system-related signs and symptoms  - mental health-related signs and symptoms  - other signs and symptoms
                
Liver-related Signs and Symptoms
                
People with Wilson disease may develop signs and symptoms of chronic, or long lasting, liver disease:
                
- weakness  - fatigue, or feeling tired  - loss of appetite  - nausea  - vomiting  - weight loss  - pain and bloating from fluid accumulating in the abdomen  - edemaswelling, usually in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face  - itching  - spiderlike blood vessels, called spider angiomas, near the surface of the skin  - muscle cramps  - jaundice, a condition that causes the skin and whites of the eyes to turn yellow
                
Some people with Wilson disease may not develop signs or symptoms of liver disease until they develop acute liver failurea condition that develops suddenly.
                
Central Nervous System-related Signs and Symptoms
                
Central nervous system-related symptoms usually appear in people after the liver has retained a lot of copper; however, signs and symptoms of liver disease may not be present. Central nervous system-related symptoms occur most often in adults and sometimes occur in children.1 Signs and symptoms include
                
- tremors or uncontrolled movements  - muscle stiffness  - problems with speech, swallowing, or physical coordination

This excess copper accumulates primarily in the liver, brain, and eyes, leading to liver disease and neurological or psychiatric symptoms.

It typically presents in late childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, though symptoms can appear at almost any age.

Symptoms of Wilson Disease
Symptoms vary depending on which organs are affected first, and they may develop gradually or appear suddenly. The most commonly affected systems are the liver, central nervous system, and psychiatric function.

Liver-Related Symptoms:
Often the first sign, especially in children and teens.

Fatigue

Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)

Abdominal swelling or pain

Hepatomegaly (enlarged liver)

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Anemia of Inflammation and Chronic Disease ?,"Anemia of inflammation and chronic disease typically develops slowly and, because it is usually mild, may cause few or no symptoms. Symptoms of anemia may also be masked by the symptoms of the underlying disease. Sometimes, AI/ACD can cause or contribute to
                
- fatigue  - weakness  - pale skin  - a fast heartbeat  - shortness of breath  - exercise intolerance","Anemia of Inflammation and Chronic Disease (AI/ACD) is a type of anemia that occurs as a result of chronic infection, autoimmune conditions, chronic kidney disease, cancer, or other long-standing inflammatory states. It is also sometimes referred to as anemia of chronic disease or anemia of chronic inflammation.

This form of anemia is typically mild to moderate, and it is often a secondary condition, meaning it arises due to an underlying chronic illness.

What Causes It?
In AI/ACD, the body:

Limits iron availability for red blood cell production

Suppresses bone marrow response to anemia

Shortens red blood cell lifespan These effects are driven by inflammatory cytokines and hormones like hepcidin, which impair iron metabolism and erythropoiesis (red blood cell production).

Symptoms of Anemia of Inflammation and Chronic Disease
The symptoms are usually non-specific and may overlap with those of the underlying illness.

General Symptoms of Anemia:
Fatigue

Weakness

Pale or sallow skin

Shortness of breath, especially with exertion

Dizziness or lightheadedness

Headache

Cold hands and feet

Chest pain or palpitations (in more severe cases)

Additional Clues May Include:
Worsening of symptoms related to the underlying disease (e.g., arthritis, infections, or kidney disease)

Poor exercise tolerance

Mild cognitive difficulties (e.g., trouble concentrating)

Symptoms are often less pronounced than in iron-deficiency anemia, even when hemoglobin levels are similarly low.

Who Is at Risk?
People with chronic infections (e.g., tuberculosis, HIV)

Individuals with autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus)

Patients with chronic kidney disease

Those undergoing cancer treatment

Elderly individuals with multiple chronic conditions

Diagnosis:
Low hemoglobin levels (mild to moderate anemia)

Normal or increased ferritin (a marker of iron stores)

Low serum iron and transferrin saturation

Normal or low total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)

Tests to evaluate the underlying inflammatory condition

Management:
Treating the underlying cause (e.g., infection, autoimmune disorder)

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in certain cases (especially in chronic kidney disease)

Iron therapy (only if there is coexisting true iron deficiency)

Monitoring rather than aggressive treatment in mild, stable cases

Note: This information is for educational purposes only and not a substitute for medical advice. If you or someone you know has symptoms of anemia or a known chronic illness, it's important to speak with a healthcare provider for evaluation and treatment.

Would you like assistance understanding how anemia-related testing or treatment is typically covered under health insurance, especially when linked to chronic disease management?","Anemia of Inflammation and Chronic Disease (AI/ACD), also known as Anemia of Chronic Disease, does not have specific symptoms.

3. Irregular heartbeats
4. Shortness of breath
5. Dizziness or lightheadedness
6. Chest pain

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Urine Blockage in Newborns ?,"Before leaving the hospital, a baby with urine blockage may urinate only small amounts or may not urinate at all. As part of the routine newborn exam, the health care provider may feel an enlarged kidney or find a closed urethra, which may indicate urine blockage. Sometimes urine blockage is not apparent until a child develops symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), including
                
- fever  - irritability  - not eating  - nausea  - diarrhea  - vomiting  - cloudy, dark, bloody, or foul-smelling urine  - urinating often

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Gas in the Digestive Tract ?,"The most common symptoms of gas are burping, passing gas, bloating, and abdominal pain or discomfort. However, not everyone experiences these symptoms.
                
Burping. Burping, or belching, once in a while, especially during and after meals, is normal. However, people who burp frequently may be swallowing too much air and releasing it before the air enters the stomach.
                
Some people who burp frequently may have an upper GI disorder, such as gastroesophageal reflux diseasea chronic condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus. People may believe that swallowing air and releasing it will relieve the discomfort, and they may intentionally or unintentionally develop a habit of burping to relieve discomfort.
                
Passing gas. Passing gas around 13 to 21 times a day is normal.2 Flatulence is excessive gas in the stomach or intestine that can cause bloating and flatus. Flatulence may be the result of problems digesting certain carbohydrates.
                
Bloating. Bloating is a feeling of fullness and swelling in the abdomen, the area between the chest and hips. Problems digesting carbohydrates may cause increased gas and bloating. However, bloating is not always caused by too much gas. Bloating may result from diseases that affect how gas moves through the intestines, such as rapid gastric emptying, or from diseases that cause intestinal obstruction, such as colon cancer. People who have had many operations, internal hernias, or bands of internal scar tissue called adhesions may experience bloating.
                
Disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can affect how gas moves through the intestines or increase pain sensitivity in the intestines. IBS is a functional GI disorder, meaning that the symptoms are caused by changes in how the digestive tract works. The most common symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with diarrhea, constipation, or both. IBS may give a sensation of bloating because of increased sensitivity to normal amounts of gas.
                
Eating a lot of fatty food can delay stomach emptying and cause bloating and discomfort, but not necessarily too much gas.
                
Abdominal pain and discomfort. People may feel abdominal pain or discomfort when gas does not move through the intestines normally. People with IBS may be more sensitive to gas and feel pain when gas is present in the intestines.","Symptoms of gas in the digestive tract include:
Bloating or abdominal distension
Cramping or discomfort
Passing gas (flatulence)
Belching (burping)
Gurgling or rumbling sounds in the abdomen
Feeling of fullness
These symptoms are usually temporary and related to swallowed air or digestion of certain foods. Persistent or painful symptoms should be evaluated by a healthcare provider.","1. Belching: Belching during or after meals is normal, but people who belch frequently may be swallowing too much air and releasing it before the air enters the stomach.

2. Flatulence: Passing gas through the rectum is also a normal body function. However, sudden increase in flatulence can be a symptom of gas in the digestive tract.

3. Abdominal bloating: People often feel bloated when their stomachs are full of gas. It can cause a visibly swollen or distended stomach.

4. Abdominal pain and discomfort: This can range from mild and dull to sharp and severe. It may also feel like a cramp. The pain may be located in one specific area or it may seem to radiate throughout the abdomen.

5. Frequent hiccups or burping.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NHPP): Information for People Treated with Pituitary Human Growth Hormone (Comprehensive Report) ?,"CJD does not cause the same symptoms in everyone. In most people who got CJD from pituitary hGH, the first signs they noticed were difficulty with walking and balance, dizziness, and/or clumsiness. Later, some began to slur words and have jerky movements. They also had trouble seeing, remembering, and/or thinking clearly. The disease becomes worse very quickly. When individuals have symptoms like these over a long period of time (such as a year) without getting much worse, they do not have CJD. Occasional forgetfulness, clumsiness, or headaches do not mean one has CJD. You should discuss concerns with your doctor if you are not sure.
                
CJD is a rare disease. Most cases of CJD are not linked to pituitary hGH. When CJD is not linked to pituitary hGH, the first symptoms are usually mental changes such as confusion, problems thinking clearly, memory loss, behavior changes, and dementia. Though symptoms may differ, there are similar changes in the brain tissue of all patients with CJD.","The National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NHPP) was established to monitor individuals who received pituitary-derived human growth hormone (hGH), primarily between 1958 and 1985, due to concerns about rare but serious long-term risks—especially Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a fatal brain disorder.
People treated with this form of hGH generally received it for growth hormone deficiency in childhood. Most individuals did not experience problems, but due to the method of hormone extraction from human pituitary glands, there is a small risk of developing CJD, which can occur years or decades after treatment.
Symptoms of concern related to CJD include: rapidly progressive dementia, memory loss, personality changes, impaired coordination or balance, visual disturbances, muscle stiffness or twitching, and difficulty speaking or swallowing. These symptoms develop quickly and worsen over time.
The NHPP provides long-term follow-up and support, but it’s important to remember that the risk is extremely rare. Anyone with a history of pituitary hGH treatment and concerning neurological symptoms should contact their healthcare provider promptly.","The National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NHPP) was a program that provided human growth hormone treatment to children with stunted growth from 1963 until 1985. The treatments were halted when it was discovered that some batches of the hormone were contaminated with a prion that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a rare and fatal degenerative brain disorder. 

It's important to note that not everyone who received the treatment will develop CJD. However, those who do may experience the following symptoms:

1. Rapidly progressing dementia
2. Memory loss
3. Personality changes
4. Hallucinations
5. Anxiety and depression
6. Poor coordination and ataxia
7. Visual disturbances
8. Weakness
9. Speech impairment
10. Difficulty swallowing
11. Severe mental impairment
12. Involuntary movements
13. Blindness
14. Coma.

These symptoms typically appear later in life, and the disease progresses rapidly once symptoms start. It's also worth noting that these symptoms can be caused by a number of other conditions, so experiencing them does not necessarily mean you have CJD. 

If you were treated with pituitary human growth hormone as a child and are experiencing these symptoms, it's important to seek medical advice. Your doctor may be able to conduct tests to determine whether you have CJD or another condition.",8.5,8.5,6.65,6.76

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Proteinuria ?,"Proteinuria has no signs or symptoms in the early stages. Large amounts of protein in the urine may cause it to look foamy in the toilet. Also, because protein has left the body, the blood can no longer soak up enough fluid, so swelling in the hands, feet, abdomen, or face may occur. This swelling is called edema. These are signs of large protein loss and indicate that kidney disease has progressed. Laboratory testing is the only way to find out whether protein is in a persons urine before extensive kidney damage occurs.
                
Several health organizations recommend regular urine checks for people at risk for CKD. A 1996 study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health determined that proteinuria is the best predictor of progressive kidney failure in people with type 2 diabetes. The American Diabetes Association recommends regular urine testing for proteinuria for people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The National Kidney Foundation recommends that routine checkups include testing for excess protein in the urine, especially for people in high-risk groups.","Proteinuria, or excess protein in the urine, often has no noticeable symptoms in its early stages and is usually detected through routine urine tests. When symptoms do appear, they may include foamy or frothy urine, swelling in the hands, feet, abdomen, or face due to fluid retention (edema), and signs of underlying kidney issues such as fatigue, reduced appetite, or changes in urine output. In more advanced cases, proteinuria can be a sign of kidney damage and may accompany high blood pressure or other symptoms of chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring is important, especially for people with diabetes or hypertension.
","1. Foamy or bubbly urine: This is the most common symptom of proteinuria. The high protein content causes the urine to look foamy or bubbly.

2. Swelling (edema): Excessive protein in urine can cause fluid imbalance leading to swelling in body parts like hands, feet, abdomen, and face.

3. Fatigue: Kidney damage associated with proteinuria can cause you to feel tired or fatigued.

4. Appetite loss: You may experience a loss of appetite.

5. Unexplained weight gain: Due to fluid retention, you may notice weight gain.

6. Frequent need to urinate: You might find yourself needing to urinate more frequently than usual, especially at night.

Dehydration
                
Being dehydrated means your body does not have enough fluid to work properly. Every time you have a bowel movement, you lose fluids. Diarrhea causes you to lose even more fluids. You also lose salts and minerals such as sodium, chloride, and potassium. These salts and minerals affect the amount of water that stays in your body.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Alagille Syndrome ?,"The signs and symptoms of Alagille syndrome and their severity vary, even among people in the same family sharing the same gene mutation.
                
Liver
                
In some people, problems in the liver may be the first signs and symptoms of the disorder. These signs and symptoms can occur in children and adults with Alagille syndrome, and in infants as early as the first 3 months of life.
                
Jaundice. Jaundicewhen the skin and whites of the eyes turn yellowis a result of the liver not removing bilirubin from the blood. Bilirubin is a reddish-yellow substance formed when hemoglobin breaks down. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. Bilirubin is absorbed by the liver, processed, and released into bile. Blockage of the bile ducts forces bilirubin and other elements of bile to build up in the blood.
                
Jaundice may be difficult for parents and even health care providers to detect. Many healthy newborns have mild jaundice during the first 1 to 2 weeks of life due to an immature liver. This normal type of jaundice disappears by the second or third week of life, whereas the jaundice of Alagille syndrome deepens. Newborns with jaundice after 2 weeks of life should be seen by a health care provider to check for a possible liver problem.
                
Dark urine and gray or white stools. High levels of bilirubin in the blood that pass into the urine can make the urine darker, while stool lightens from a lack of bilirubin reaching the intestines. Gray or white bowel movements after 2 weeks of age are a reliable sign of a liver problem and should prompt a visit to a health care provider.
                
Pruritus. The buildup of bilirubin in the blood may cause itching, also called pruritus. Pruritus usually starts after 3 months of age and can be severe.
                
Xanthomas. Xanthomas are fatty deposits that appear as yellow bumps on the skin. They are caused by abnormally high cholesterol levels in the blood, common in people with liver disease. Xanthomas may appear anywhere on the body. However, xanthomas are usually found on the elbows, joints, tendons, knees, hands, feet, or buttocks.
                
Other Signs and Symptoms of Alagille Syndrome
                
Certain signs of Alagille syndrome are unique to the disorder, including those that affect the vertebrae and facial features.
                
Face. Many children with Alagille syndrome have deep-set eyes, a straight nose, a small and pointed chin, large ears, and a prominent, wide forehead. These features are not usually recognized until after infancy. By adulthood, the chin is more prominent.
                
Eyes. Posterior embryotoxon is a condition in which an opaque ring is present in the cornea, the transparent covering of the eyeball. The abnormality is common in people with Alagille syndrome, though it usually does not affect vision.
                
Skeleton. The most common skeletal defect in a person with Alagille syndrome is when the shape of the vertebraebones of the spinegives the appearance of flying butterflies. This defect, known as ""butterfly"" vertebrae, rarely causes medical problems or requires treatment.
                
Heart and blood vessels. People with Alagille syndrome may have the following signs and symptoms having to do with the heart and blood vessels:
                
- heart murmuran extra or unusual sound heard during a heartbeat. A heart murmur is the most common sign of Alagille syndrome other than the general symptoms of liver disease.1 Most people with Alagille syndrome have a narrowing of the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs.1 This narrowing causes a murmur that can be heard with a stethoscope. Heart murmurs usually do not cause problems.  - heart walls and valve problems. A small number of people with Alagille syndrome have serious problems with the walls or valves of the heart. These conditions may need treatment with medications or corrective surgery.  - blood vessel problems. People with Alagille syndrome may have abnormalities of the blood vessels in the head and neck. This serious complication can lead to internal bleeding or stroke. Alagille syndrome can also cause narrowing or bulging of other blood vessels in the body.
                
Kidney disease. A wide range of kidney diseases can occur in Alagille syndrome. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist, that filter wastes and extra fluid from the blood. Some people have small kidneys or have cystsfluid-filled sacsin the kidneys. Kidney function can also decrease.","Alagille syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects the liver, heart, and other parts of the body. Symptoms often appear in early childhood and can vary widely in severity. Liver-related symptoms include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), itching, pale stools, dark urine, and poor growth due to problems with bile flow. Heart problems, such as narrowing of the pulmonary arteries, may cause murmurs, fatigue, or cyanosis (bluish skin). Other signs can include distinct facial features (such as a broad forehead, deep-set eyes, and pointed chin), skeletal abnormalities (especially butterfly-shaped vertebrae), and eye changes. Kidney issues and developmental delays may also be present. Diagnosis is typically confirmed through genetic testing and evaluation of organ function.","1. Jaundice: Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes due to liver dysfunction.

2. Cholestasis: A condition in which the flow of bile from the liver is slow or stopped.

3. Itching: Due to the buildup of bile acids in the skin.

4. Xanthomas: Fatty deposits under the skin caused by high cholesterol levels.

5. Heart murmurs or other signs of heart problems.

6. Distinctive facial features: A prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, a straight nose, and a pointed chin.

7. Kidney disease: Some people may have kidney problems, which can lead to high blood pressure and other issues.

8. Skeletal abnormalities: These can include a broad forehead, high hairline, deep-set eyes, straight nose, small pointed chin, and abnormalities in the vertebrae.

9. Growth problems: Children with Alagille syndrome often have growth problems, resulting in short stature.

10. Eye abnormalities: The eyes may have a peculiar appearance due to an extra, circular line on the surface of the eye (Posterior embryotoxon).

11. Intellectual disabilities: Though less common, some individuals with Alagille syndrome may have learning difficulties and delays in development.

Getting prompt treatment for a stroke can reduce the damage to the brain and improve chances for recovery.","To keep your heart and blood vessels healthy and prevent diabetes-related complications, it's important to watch for early signs of cardiovascular problems. These symptoms may include chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, fatigue during routine activities, swelling in the legs or ankles, numbness or coldness in the hands and feet, and pain in the legs while walking. In people with diabetes, heart disease can sometimes be silent, meaning there may be no obvious symptoms until a serious event like a heart attack occurs. Regular checkups, blood pressure and cholesterol control, a heart-healthy diet, physical activity, and not smoking are key to prevention and early detection.","Prevent diabetes problems: Keep your heart and blood vessels healthy isn't a condition with symptoms. It's a general advice for those with diabetes to manage their condition and prevent further health complications. However, if diabetes is not managed effectively, it can lead to heart and blood vessel problems, and the symptoms may include:

1. Chest pain or discomfort
2. Shortness of breath
3. Fatigue
4. Swelling in the ankles, feet, and legs
5. Rapid or irregular heartbeat
6. Numbness or weakness in the limbs
7. Dizziness or fainting

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Primary Hyperparathyroidism ?,"Most people with primary hyperparathyroidism have no symptoms. When symptoms appear, they are often mild and nonspecific, such as
                
- muscle weakness  - fatigue and an increased need for sleep  - feelings of depression  - aches and pains in bones and joints
                
People with more severe disease may have
                
- loss of appetite  - nausea  - vomiting  - constipation  - confusion or impaired thinking and memory  - increased thirst and urination
                
These symptoms are mainly due to the high blood calcium levels that result from excessive PTH.","Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs when one or more of the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to elevated calcium levels in the blood. Symptoms can be mild or absent in early stages, but as the condition progresses, common symptoms may include fatigue, muscle weakness, depression or mood changes, bone pain, and joint aches. People may also experience frequent urination, kidney stones, abdominal pain, nausea, or constipation. In more severe cases, it can lead to osteoporosis and fragile bones. Since symptoms can be subtle or mistaken for other conditions, diagnosis often begins with blood tests showing high calcium and PTH levels.","1. Fatigue and general feeling of malaise

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Henoch-Schnlein Purpura ?,"The symptoms of HSP include the following:
                
- Rash. Leaking blood vessels in the skin cause a rash that looks like bruises or small red dots on the legs, arms, and buttocks. The rash may first look like hives and then change to look like bruises, and it may spread to the chest, back, and face. The rash does not disappear or turn pale when pressed.  - Digestive tract problems. HSP can cause vomiting and abdominal pain, which can range from mild to severe. Blood may also appear in the stool, though severe bleeding is rare.  - Arthritis. Pain and swelling can occur in the joints, usually in the knees and ankles and less frequently in the elbows and wrists.  - Kidney involvement. Hematuria blood in the urineis a common sign that HSP has affected the kidneys. Proteinurialarge amounts of protein in the urineor development of high blood pressure suggests more severe kidney problems.  - Other symptoms. In some cases, boys with HSP develop swelling of the testicles. Symptoms affecting the central nervous system, such as seizures, and lungs, such as pneumonia, have been seen in rare cases.
                
Though the rash affects all people with HSP, pain in the joints or abdomen precedes the rash in about one-third of cases by as many as 14 days.1","Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) is a form of vasculitis (blood vessel inflammation) that most commonly affects children but can occur in adults as well. The hallmark symptom is a purplish rash (purpura), usually on the lower legs and buttocks. Other common symptoms include joint pain or swelling, especially in the knees and ankles; abdominal pain, which may be crampy and sometimes accompanied by vomiting or blood in the stool; and kidney involvement, which may cause blood or protein in the urine. Symptoms often follow a respiratory infection and can vary in severity. Most cases resolve on their own, but monitoring is important to manage potential kidney complications.","1. Rash: The most distinctive symptom of Henoch-Schönlein Purpura is a rash that appears as red or purple spots, usually on the legs but also on the arms, torso or buttocks. The spots are actually areas of bleeding under the skin.

2. Joint Pain and Swelling: Pain and swelling in the joints, particularly the knees and ankles, is another common symptom.

3. Abdominal Pain: This can be severe and may be associated with nausea, vomiting, and sometimes bloody stools.

4. Kidney Involvement: In some cases, Henoch-Schönlein Purpura can affect the kidneys, leading to blood in the urine or protein in the urine. In severe cases, it can result in kidney damage.

5. Fever: A high temperature, fatigue or general feeling of being unwell.

6. Swelling: Swelling (edema) can occur in different parts of the body, including the hands, feet, and face.

7. Headache or loss of appetite may also be present.

One or more of these symptoms can be the first sign of kidney disease. But how would you know, for example, whether you have proteinuria? Before seeing a doctor, you may not. But some of these symptoms have signs, or visible manifestations:
                
- Proteinuria may cause foamy urine.  - Blood may cause the urine to be pink or cola-colored.  - Edema may be obvious in hands and ankles, especially at the end of the day, or around the eyes when awakening in the morning, for example.","Glomerular diseases affect the glomeruli—the tiny filtering units in the kidneys—and can lead to a range of symptoms depending on the type and severity. Common symptoms include blood in the urine (which may appear pink, red, or cola-colored), protein in the urine (often causing foamy urine), swelling in the face, hands, abdomen, or legs due to fluid retention, high blood pressure, and reduced urine output. Some people may also experience fatigue and nausea if kidney function worsens. In early stages, glomerular disease may not cause noticeable symptoms, so routine urine and blood tests are important for detection.","1. Swelling or edema: This is often seen in the eyes, legs, or arms. It is caused by the kidneys not being able to remove excess fluid and salt from the body.

2. Foamy or bubbly urine: This is due to excess protein in the urine, a condition known as proteinuria. 

3. Blood in the urine: This can cause the urine to appear pink or brown. 

4. High blood pressure: The kidneys play a major role in controlling blood pressure, so any damage to them can cause the blood pressure to rise.

5. Fatigue: This can be caused by the kidneys not properly filtering waste and toxins from the blood.

6. Loss of appetite: This may be due to the build-up of toxins in the blood, which can affect taste and cause nausea.

7. Trouble sleeping: This may be due to itchiness or restless leg syndrome, both of which can be symptoms of kidney disease.

8. Frequent urination, especially at night.

9. Shortness of breath: This may be due to fluid build-up in the lungs or anemia, a common complication of kidney disease.

10. Kidney pain: This is usually felt in the back or side.

symptoms,What are the symptoms of Prolactinoma ?,"In women, high levels of prolactin in the blood often cause infertility and changes in menstruation. In some women, periods may stop. In others, periods may become irregular or menstrual flow may change. Women who are not pregnant or nursing may begin producing breast milk. Some women may experience a loss of libido-interest in sex. Intercourse may become painful because of vaginal dryness.
                
In men, the most common symptom of prolactinoma is erectile dysfunction. Because men have no reliable indicator such as changes in menstruation to signal a problem, many men delay going to the doctor until they have headaches or eye problems caused by the enlarged pituitary pressing against nearby optic nerves. They may not recognize a gradual loss of sexual function or libido. Only after treatment do some men realize they had a problem with sexual function.","Prolactinoma is a noncancerous tumor of the pituitary gland that produces excess prolactin. In women, common symptoms include irregular or absent menstrual periods, galactorrhea (milk production not related to childbirth or nursing), infertility, and low libido. In men, symptoms may include erectile dysfunction, reduced sex drive, infertility, and, in some cases, breast enlargement. Both men and women may experience headaches and vision problems if the tumor is large enough to press on surrounding tissues. Diagnosis is typically confirmed through blood tests and imaging studies such as an MRI.","Prolactinoma is a benign tumor of the pituitary gland that produces a hormone called prolactin.
