0,Leg pain after 4ml IM injection,"I'm a regular user of anabolic steroids, peptides, etc. 5 days ago I injected 4ml of a testosterone that had the concentration level of 500mg/ml. It had about 3% Benzyl Alcohol added to it and was filtered through a 0.22nm nylon filter.

The next day, I couldn't walk. I have swelling at the injection site and around/above my knee cap. It's very, very difficult to walk, and the pain is near unbearable if my leg isn't elevated/at level with my body; so I've been near bed ridden for the past 4 days.

Symptoms: Swelling, slight redness at injection site, warmth from injection site, spontaneous (what I can only describe as) muscle spasms; a few times a day, whether going to the bathroom or lying in bed not moving, my quadricep will twitch/spasm. Injection site is very 'tough' and 'hard'; tissue scarring? 

There is no visible abscess. I don't have a fever. No difficulty in breathing or elevated heart rate. No vomiting. My appetite seems a bit suppressed, but could be because of the heat we're experiencing. I did have a nose bleed yesterday but that could've been from my mild hay fever. Tensing my leg is pretty much impossible. Bending my leg at the knee to any acute angle is impossible; feels like my knee and injection site has massive pressure on them. I've been sleeping with my leg slightly elevated, trying to keep off it (probably only spending about 10 minutes on my feet a day).

I've been taking ibuprofen for pain/inflammation but doesn't help.

Basically my two problem areas are at injection site, around upper/outer kneecap (where the quad ends?).

I'll be going to my doctor Monday.


I used a 1.25"" 25g needle, area swabbed with an alcohol prep pad before injection. I inject 4-5ml often (though it's been about 4 months since I injected either of my quads, keeping it to delts, pecs and glutes).

Any possible insight would be appreciated.","Although I don't know anything about the creator, I think it is actually a pretty neat subreddit which I so far have enjoyed partaking in. I'm currently studying for my USMLE Step 2 CK (medical boards) and it's a nice academic distraction from my studies (yet I'm still studying by attempting to answer people's questions). As far as your situation goes, I must agree partially with KentGrz, but I am still leaning more towards cellulitis/infection. I understand you don't currently have systemic signs of infection (fever, elevated heart rate, etc.) but that could be 2/2 the steroids reducing the inflammatory response and also the NSAIDS you are taking for the pain. There may be no abscess for a considerable period, but what you describe sounds like a very indurated region that may potentially become one later. And you are correct that most likely a good course of antibiotics should do the trick. Get well soon!","Thank you for providing such a detailed history. First and most importantly, while I can provide information to help you understand your situation better, this is not medical advice, and you should seek immediate medical evaluation, ideally today rather than waiting until Monday. Based on the symptoms you describe Â— significant swelling, warmth, hardness at the injection site, radiating pain toward the knee, inability to bend the leg, and spontaneous muscle spasms Â— there is concern for a serious complication following your intramuscular (IM) injection. Although you do not report fever, difficulty breathing, or an elevated heart rate (which are reassuring signs), the presence of extreme pain, difficulty moving the leg, and tissue hardness suggests that you could be experiencing a severe local inflammatory reaction, a deep tissue infection, or in more serious cases, compartment syndrome.

Injecting 4mL of a highly concentrated testosterone solution (500mg/mL) into the quadriceps, especially with 3% benzyl alcohol content, can cause significant irritation and trauma to the tissue. This irritation can lead to sterile inflammation, but it can also predispose the tissue to infection even if sterile technique was used. The hardness you are feeling could represent tissue scarring, sterile abscess formation, or early signs of infection. Muscle spasms might be the result of local inflammation affecting nearby nerves and muscles. While the absence of fever might seem reassuring, infections Â— particularly in individuals who regularly use anabolic steroids Â— can present atypically because steroids suppress normal immune system responses. Thus, the seriousness of your situation cannot be judged based on the absence of fever alone.

Because of the concerning symptoms and the potential risks Â— including permanent muscle or nerve damage if an abscess, deep infection, or compartment syndrome is present Â— you should not wait until Monday to see your doctor. It is highly recommended that you present to an urgent care center or an emergency department today. There, they can perform a physical examination, imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI if needed, and potentially lab tests to assess for infection or tissue damage. They may also start antibiotics or perform drainage procedures if indicated. Until you are seen, you should avoid massaging the area, avoid further injections in the leg, and continue elevating it to minimize swelling, but you should not apply ice or heat until a healthcare provider evaluates the injury.

In summary, your symptoms after the IM injection are concerning for a serious underlying problem that requires urgent medical assessment. Prompt intervention is critical to prevent further complications. If you would like, I can also prepare a list of questions you might ask your doctor to ensure you cover the important points during your visit.","Leg pain after 4ml IM injection

Any possible insight would be appreciated.","I'm an AI, not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. Your symptoms could be due to a number of things, including an infection, an allergic reaction to the substances in the injection, or a nerve or muscle injury from the injection itself. 

Pain, swelling, and redness are common signs of an infection. They can also be signs of an allergic reaction. The hardness and toughness at the injection site could be due to inflammation or scarring.

The muscle spasms could be due to nerve or muscle damage from the injection, or they could be a reaction to the substances in the injection.

The fact that you don't have a fever or other systemic symptoms is a good sign. However, these symptoms can also develop later, so it's important to keep an eye out for them.

Ibuprofen can help with the pain and inflammation, but it's not going to treat the underlying cause of your symptoms.

You're doing the right thing by going to see your doctor. They can evaluate your symptoms, perform any necessary tests, and give you the appropriate treatment.

Remember, this is just general information. Your doctor will be able to give you more accurate and specific advice. It's important to be honest about your use of anabolic steroids and other substances, as this can affect your treatment and prognosis. 

Anabolic steroids can have serious side effects, including infections, abscesses, and nerve or muscle damage. They can also increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, liver disease, and other serious health problems. It's important to discuss these risks with your doctor.",7.5,7.5,4.81,5.39
1,"Exhausted, out of breath","Hi everyone, Today I went to another city with my mother and a friend of hers. The man is 58 of age and can't walk more then 20 meters without being totally incapable of continuing to walk by being out of breath completely and exhausted. He has this inhaler he has to use which he got from a doctor, but the inhaler doesn't do a damn thing as it's the same story 5 minutes later. I noticed he doesn't breath like it should, slow and under control. He takes big gasps trough his nose with each breath he takes, you can see his whole torso move with each breath. We talked about it, he says his doctor told him to stop smoking, eventho he hasn't been a hard smoker, and only smokes about 3 sigarettes a day now. It's been stated before by some specialist that his lung capacity is smaller, but I've honnestly never seen a grown man struggle that bad over such small distances. They checked his blood, rayed his lungs, they say he's fine and in good condition. I however can't bear to see him suffer in this way, I wonder if this is a known thing? Are these doctors of him ignoring other possibilities? I guess what I would like to know, is that if there is medication for shortness of breath other then cheap asmatic inhalers that don't work. And if there is a way to progresively increase his lung capacity? He is a very frail man that had some rough injuries if it interests. Thank you for your time.","Sounds like he has COPD since you say his lung capacity is smaller and he has a history of smoking. I'm sure his doctors have also worked him up for congestive heart failure and other causes of shortness of breath. The inhaler will only do so much for him, especially if he continues to smoke. COPD is a debilitating disease and I'm sorry that you have to experience it through a friend, but it is also a progressive disease and there is not much that can be done to reverse his situation. If he does worsen however, he needs to seek medical attention as he may need steroids added to his medication regimen.","Thank you for describing the situation with such compassion and detail. I can sense how much you care about your mother's friend, and it's understandable that watching him struggle like this is deeply concerning. Based on your description, this man is experiencing **severe breathlessness (dyspnea)** with even minimal exertion, despite having been evaluated by doctors who reportedly found no major issues on lung imaging and blood work. His breathing pattern Â— large gasping breaths, heavy torso movement Â— suggests that he is working very hard to breathe, which is abnormal and typically reflects **serious respiratory compromise**, even if standard tests appear relatively normal.

There are a few important points to consider. First, having a Â“smaller lung capacityÂ” may refer to underlying conditions like **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, **pulmonary fibrosis**, or **restrictive lung disease** from prior injury, even if he is not a heavy smoker. Sometimes, especially in frail individuals or those with past trauma, the lung tissues or the muscles that support breathing (like the diaphragm) weaken. In such cases, basic chest X-rays and blood tests might not capture the functional limitations Â— more specialized testing like **pulmonary function tests (PFTs)** or a **6-minute walk test** would give better insight into how his lungs work in practice. ItÂ’s also worth noting that heart issues can mimic lung issues Â— conditions like **heart failure** can cause shortness of breath with exertion, and these problems might not always be picked up unless very specific cardiac testing (like an echocardiogram or BNP blood test) is done.

Regarding medications, you are correct: there are many treatments beyond standard Â“cheap asthma inhalers.Â” If his problem is related to COPD, for example, **long-acting bronchodilators** (like tiotropium or salmeterol) and **inhaled corticosteroids** might help significantly. If it's more of a cardiac problem or pulmonary hypertension, then entirely different medications would be needed. Simply giving him a quick-relief inhaler without addressing the underlying cause is often inadequate for someone this severely limited. Additionally, **pulmonary rehabilitation programs** Â— supervised exercise and breathing therapy designed for people with serious lung conditions Â— can sometimes improve functional ability even when lung damage is permanent.

In summary, based on your description, it seems his situation is not normal and **warrants further investigation**, potentially by a pulmonologist (lung specialist) or cardiologist (heart specialist). It does not seem acceptable to simply attribute his struggles to smoking or minor lung issues without a deeper evaluation. **Persistent severe shortness of breath with minimal exertion always deserves serious attention**. ItÂ’s good that youÂ’re advocating for him, and I would encourage pushing for specialist referrals if at all possible. 

If you'd like, I can also suggest specific types of tests or treatments you might want to ask about on his behalf. Would you like me to?","Exhausted, out of breath

It's important that your mother's friend consult with his healthcare provider about his symptoms and concerns. 

As for increasing lung capacity, some possible methods include regular exercise, practicing deep breathing exercises, and quitting smoking completely. Certain medications and treatments can help manage the symptoms of conditions that cause shortness of breath, but the effectiveness would depend on the specific cause.

2,Do these symptoms mean I should get a colonoscopy?,"My question is about the necessity of a colonoscopy and the sensible timeline for getting one.

I'm 24 and have been having bowel disturbances for about five months -- frequent (at least 4-6 times/day) bowel movements, bloating and gas every evening, and about once a month or two some light rectal bleeding. Besides bloating dull ache, I feel occasional sharp pain in my lower left abdomen. 

Have done tests to rule out common viral/bacterial infections and ulcerative colitis and tried IBS medicine for a month (not much help). 

Saw bowel specialist who is having me get some blood work and another pathogen test done. He recommended a colonoscopy to check for inflammation.

Now, I'm from the US but currently work in New Zealand and would have to pay for the colonoscopy (about $1500-2000) out of pocket if I get it done here. If I wait until I come home in December, my US insurance would probably cover it.

I'm hoping for advice on any danger there could be in waiting. I guess I've gotten used to the symptoms and have found that changing my diet alleviates them a bit. If symptoms go away, would it be a bad idea to forego a colonoscopy all together?

I've read stories about younger people getting bowel cancer and having it go undetected because it's seen as a disease older people get, so that's in the back of my mind.

Complicating or perhaps explaining all this, I was on two courses of antibiotics for unrelated infections during the last four months and three other courses in the past year....and I have had severe food allergies all my life to dairy, nuts and shellfish. When I was younger I had minor allergies to wheat and soy.

I cut soy and wheat out of my diet in the past week and have found some symptoms have improved a bit.","Is there any family history of colon cancer or any other colon pathology? Describe the stool for us. There are times when younger patients do get colonoscopies (e.g. if you have HNPCC or Lynch syndrome, screening can start as early as 25 y.o or if you have a family hx of colon cancer). Your bowel specialist is correct in recommending a colonoscopy. I have no idea how ulcerative colitis was ruled out without having the colonoscopy w/ biopsies (bloodwork for ASCA and ANCA usually are done only if the diagnosis is not clear in IBS).","Thank you for providing such a detailed and thoughtful description of your situation. Based on what youÂ’ve shared, it sounds like you are being very proactive and thoughtful about your health Â— which is important. To clarify, I cannot provide medical advice, but I can help you think through the healthcare decision-making process.

Given your symptoms Â— chronic bowel disturbances, intermittent rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and a history of food allergies Â— your specialistÂ’s recommendation for a colonoscopy seems appropriate. While at 24 years old the risk of colon cancer is statistically low, it is not zero, and persistent symptoms like bleeding and localized pain, particularly after common causes like infection and ulcerative colitis have been ruled out, do warrant further evaluation to rule out inflammatory bowel disease (like Crohn's), microscopic colitis, or, more rarely, neoplasia. Your recent history of multiple antibiotic courses could also point toward gut microbiome disturbances, but without direct visualization of your colon, it's difficult to know whether thereÂ’s significant inflammation or structural issues.

Regarding timing, waiting until December (about 7 months from now) is not necessarily dangerous if your symptoms remain stable or improve Â— particularly since you are finding some symptom relief with dietary changes. However, if you experience worsening symptoms Â— such as increasing bleeding, weight loss, significant fatigue, fever, or worsening pain Â— it would be safer to pursue the colonoscopy sooner, even if it means paying out-of-pocket. In some cases, delaying evaluation could allow an underlying inflammatory or other condition to worsen, though that risk varies based on the underlying cause, which remains unclear at this point.

If your symptoms substantially improve or resolve with diet alone, your doctor might reassess the urgency of a colonoscopy, but generally speaking, rectal bleeding (even light and intermittent) usually warrants further evaluation. ItÂ’s also important to discuss with your specialist whether a less invasive test (like a fecal calprotectin test, which checks for intestinal inflammation) could guide the urgency of doing the colonoscopy.

Ultimately, I would encourage you to stay in close communication with your specialist in New Zealand and to monitor your symptoms carefully. ItÂ’s very reasonable to weigh the financial cost, but prioritizing your health is essential, especially given your unique history. And remember, the information IÂ’ve provided is not medical advice Â— please discuss these options thoroughly with your healthcare provider. 

Would you like me to help you sketch out a list of Â“red flagÂ” symptoms that would suggest you should not wait?","Do these symptoms mean I should get a colonoscopy?

Your symptoms are concerning, especially the persistent bowel disturbances and rectal bleeding. These can be signs of several conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulosis, or even colon cancer. Although colon cancer is rare in young adults, it's not impossible. 

The antibiotics you've taken could have disrupted your gut microbiome, leading to bowel disturbances. Your food allergies may also play a role in your symptoms. 

Your doctor's recommendation to get a colonoscopy is likely due to wanting to rule out serious conditions. A colonoscopy can provide a lot of valuable information and can directly visualize the interior of your colon. 

Whether to get the colonoscopy now or wait until December is a personal decision that should be made after discussing with your healthcare provider. If your symptoms get worse, it might be worth getting the colonoscopy sooner rather than later. If your symptoms improve significantly, you might decide to wait.

3,How can I fight my Rosacea problem,I am a 21 year old male turning 22 next month. I have been fighting Acne Rosacea for around 8 years. I have had times when my face was all red and flaky while at other times not so bad. I'm desperately looking for a way to get rid of this as it greatly affects my social life. I have tried all sorts of moisturizing creams and oils but nothing seems to have a permanent solution to this problem. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could tell me how they have had to overcome this problem because 8 years is a long time and I don't want it to continue for another 8 or more.,"Rosacea is a difficult dermatological condition. Creams and oils applied on the affected area can actually be a trigger/cause of the inflammation. As with most dermatology problems, try to use products that have the best record of non-irritability e.g. ""cetaphil"" type products. One thing you could try if you haven't already is to instead of sleeping on a pillow directly, use a clean towel that you launder everyday with just water and plain bleach and sleep on that on top of your pillow. It's often a recommended tip for acne vulgaris, but it's quite applicable in this situation as all you are trying to do is limit your contact time of your face with things that may irritate it, including a dirty pillow.","Thank you for sharing your experience Â— it sounds like youÂ’ve been through a long and frustrating journey with your skin, and it's completely understandable that itÂ’s taking a toll on your social confidence. While I can't provide medical advice or a treatment plan, I can help you understand your options based on current knowledge about rosacea management.

Rosacea, especially when it includes acne-like breakouts (known as papulopustular rosacea), can be a chronic and recurring condition. Unfortunately, there isnÂ’t a Â“permanent cureÂ” at this time, but many people find substantial and lasting improvements with the right combination of treatments and lifestyle adjustments. Moisturizers and oils alone often arenÂ’t enough because rosacea involves both inflammation and vascular instability Â— it typically requires a combination approach.

Common medical treatments include topical prescription medications like metronidazole, azelaic acid, ivermectin cream, or even oral antibiotics like doxycycline at low doses to reduce inflammation over time. Some newer treatments, like topical brimonidine or oxymetazoline, can specifically reduce redness by constricting blood vessels temporarily. In more resistant cases, dermatologists might recommend laser therapy or intense pulsed light (IPL), which can target visible blood vessels and reduce persistent redness.

Managing triggers is also crucial. Many people with rosacea notice flares with sun exposure, hot or spicy foods, alcohol, stress, or certain skin products. A gentle skincare routine Â— avoiding harsh scrubs, alcohol-based toners, and heavily fragranced products Â— is essential. Sunscreen is non-negotiable: daily use of a mineral-based sunscreen (zinc oxide or titanium dioxide) can significantly reduce flares.

Since you've already tried moisturizing creams and oils without lasting success, it might be time to seek a dermatologist's evaluation if you haven't recently. They could help create a tailored treatment plan based on whether your rosacea is more inflammatory, vascular, or a combination. It's also worth noting that persistence is important Â— many treatments can take 8Â–12 weeks to show clear improvement.

And finally, itÂ’s important to acknowledge the emotional side of living with a visible skin condition. You are not alone in feeling that it impacts your social life. Psychological support Â— whether thatÂ’s counseling or connecting with others facing similar challenges Â— can be a key part of coping.

If you'd like, I can also outline some specific questions you could ask a dermatologist during your next appointment to make sure you get a comprehensive treatment discussion. Would you like me to do that?","How can I fight my Rosacea problem

Here are some suggestions that may help manage Rosacea:

1. Medications: Your dermatologist may prescribe oral antibiotics, topical creams, or even acne drugs such as isotretinoin for severe cases.

2. Laser treatment: Some people with Rosacea find relief with laser treatments that target the redness and visible blood vessels.

3. Skincare routine: Avoid harsh skin care products and opt for gentle, fragrance-free ones. It's also important to protect your skin from the sun by wearing sunscreen daily.

4. Lifestyle changes: Certain triggers can worsen Rosacea, such as hot drinks, spicy foods, alcohol, stress, and extreme temperatures. Monitor your symptoms to identify and avoid your personal triggers.

5. Diet: A healthy diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods like fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids can potentially improve symptoms.

6. Regular exercise: Regular, moderate exercise can help reduce stress and inflammation, but be careful not to overheat, as this can trigger a flare-up.

7. Support groups: Connecting with others who have Rosacea can provide emotional support and practical tips. 

Remember, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any treatment. Each person responds differently to treatments, so it may take some trial and error to find what works best for you.",7.5,6.5,6.66,6.7
4,Thought I was going to die yesterday.,"I (33 M) was standing in the kitchen yesterday when a wave of dizziness, high bp and heart rate came over me. I couldn't stand, and basically fell to he floor. My wife called an ambulance right away. Lying on the floor, I remained conscious, but really dizzy and I thought I might pass out at any moment. There was a persistent tingling in both my hands. I was scared for my life at this time.

The EMT's came and took my pressure. It was at 163/120 and my rate was at 123 (if I remember correctly). I was taken to hospital, and there I had to wait for 7 hours before seeing a doctor. All this time I felt dizzy, and sometimes it came in stronger. 

They did a complete bloodwork, urine, ecg, and a chest x-ray. Everything was normal there, well as normal as you'd expect from a smoker who drinks a bit more than average. 

I was discharged, went home and slept. Right now I feel a bit weak. I feel a lot better then yesterday, but a little light-headed and weak.

I got to thinking that my anxiety may have been a factor here, but I am no doctor, so that's why I am writing this.

What I am hoping for is a possible explanation for what happened, because when my tests came back negative, it left me a bit nervous.

If any additional info is needed, I'll provide through a PM.","There's a difference between panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. They are two different diagnosis even though they have similarities and it's very difficult to say which one you may have. I would suggest that when you do visit your doctor, especially if it is a GP, to ask politely to be referred to a psychiatrist to get this properly diagnosed as the treatment does vary slightly. I'm not so up to date on DSM V because it just came out a couple months ago, but I did recently finish my psych rotation and I'm leaning more towards panic disorder especially when you mentioned ""hoping for a possible explanation/negative tests left you more nervous"". A pt w/ panic disorder characteristically has anxiety secondary to fear of having the next panic attack.","Thank you for sharing such a detailed account Â— itÂ’s clear this was a frightening experience for you, and it's completely understandable that you are still feeling uneasy after such an event, especially without clear answers. While I cannot provide medical advice or a diagnosis, I can help you think through some possibilities that you can discuss further with your healthcare providers.

The sudden onset of severe dizziness, a spike in blood pressure (163/120 is considered very high), a fast heart rate, tingling in both hands, and a feeling of near-fainting points to a significant acute event. ItÂ’s encouraging that your major tests (blood work, ECG, chest x-ray) came back normal, but itÂ’s important to remember that many causes of these symptoms can be transient or not immediately obvious on basic testing. Anxiety and panic attacks can indeed cause very real, dramatic physical symptoms Â— including surges in blood pressure and heart rate, dizziness, tingling, and even the feeling that you are about to pass out. However, typically with anxiety or panic, the episode peaks within minutes and then gradually resolves, although the physical aftermath (like feeling weak or lightheaded) can last longer.

That said, given your history of smoking and drinking more than average, itÂ’s important not to simply assume anxiety was the cause without considering other possibilities. Conditions like transient ischemic attacks (TIAs, sometimes called mini-strokes), cardiac arrhythmias, vestibular (inner ear) disorders, or even issues with blood pressure regulation could also cause similar symptoms. Some of these conditions might not show up immediately on an ECG or basic blood work, particularly if the episode had passed by the time you were evaluated.

It would be very reasonable for you to follow up with your primary care doctor (or ideally a cardiologist or neurologist, depending on what your doctor recommends) to discuss further evaluation. Sometimes, a longer heart rhythm monitor (like a 24-hour Holter monitor), more detailed imaging (like a brain MRI), or evaluation for autonomic nervous system disorders may be needed based on your symptoms.

Your sense that anxiety could have contributed is valid and possible, but itÂ’s important to rule out other medical causes first Â— especially when it was such a sudden and dramatic event. And finally, the fact that you still feel light-headed and weak could simply be your body recovering from a major stressor, but it's also another reason to keep monitoring how you feel closely.","Thought I was going to die yesterday.

The EMT's came and took my pressure. It was at 163/120 and my rate was at 123 (if I remember correctly). I was taken to hospital, and there I had to wait for 7 hours before seeing a doctor. All this time I felt dizzy, and sometimes it came in stronger. 

They did a complete bloodwork, urine, ecg, and a chest x-ray. Everything was normal there, well as normal as you'd expect from a smoker who drinks a bit more than average. 

I was discharged, went home and slept. Right now I feel a bit weak. I feel a lot better then yesterday, but a little light-headed and weak.

I got to thinking that my anxiety may have been a factor here, but I am no doctor, so that's why I am writing this.

What I am hoping for is a possible explanation for what happened, because when my tests came back negative, it left me a bit nervous.

If any additional info is needed, I'll provide through a PM.","I'm an AI and not a doctor, but what you're describing could be a panic attack, which can sometimes mimic the symptoms of a heart attack.

6,Fainted the other night... should I be worried?,"So background info first: I'm 21 y/o male, 170lbs, athletic and in good shape. No real past medical history.

So the other night I was out drinking with my apartmentmates. We got drunk before we left and went out to a bar. I had one beer while I was there. This was, by no means, a very drunk night for me - I probably had 8 beers over the course of 4 or 5 hours.

At about 2:00, we hit the McDonalds down the block and were planning on going to another place afterwards (bars close at 3am here). I was feeling fine - we each got some McNuggets and as I was eating them, I started feeling a little lightheaded. A couple minutes later, my vision just tunnel vision-ed to black. I stood there for a few seconds, rather alarmed, before I was like ""guys fuck I can't see anything."" Next thing I know, I woke up slumped down against the wall and people were standing around me. I got up and found a seat and we sat down (after a thoughtful ""keep an eye on him"" from the security guard) and we got a cab home and I was fine for the rest of the night. I was really sweaty after it happened but that went away within like 20 mins. 

I have no idea how this happened. I ate breakfast lunch and dinner. I remember everything, except for the 1-2 minutes between when I couldn't see and when I woke up on the floor. The only thing that I could possibly think it could be is dehydration, because I didn't have much to drink all day. But I thought that the dehydration effect of alcohol took a little longer to sink in since I'd had a lot of fluids and my urine wasn't bright yellow or anything. Again, I wasn't that drunk. I've been much more intoxicated, and nothing like this has ever happened.

TLDR: Passed out for seemingly no reason. WebMD seems to think I might have MS, but that seems unlikely so I figured I'd ask.","Uhhh I agree... nothing about your background even fits MS demographics (F, 30's-40's, episodes of neurological problems varying from weakness, sensory, to cognitive problems over the course of a long period of time). I'd just be more careful of monitoring if anyone put anything in your drink while you were out. - 4th year med student w/ lots of personal experience =P","Thank you for sharing such a detailed account Â— it really helps paint a clear picture of what happened. It's completely understandable to be alarmed by this, especially since it was sudden and outside your usual experience. IÂ’ll walk you through some general thoughts based on your description, though please remember this is not medical advice, and you should definitely discuss this event with a healthcare professional.

From what you described Â— feeling lightheaded, tunnel vision, then a brief loss of consciousness followed by sweating Â— it sounds like you experienced a vasovagal syncope, which is the most common type of fainting. It happens when your body overreacts to certain triggers (like dehydration, standing for too long, heat, alcohol, emotional distress, or a sudden drop in blood pressure). Essentially, your heart rate and blood pressure drop suddenly, reducing blood flow to the brain and causing you to faint.

Several factors from your night out could have contributed: mild dehydration (even if your urine wasnÂ’t dark, you might still have been a little volume-depleted), alcohol (which can lower blood pressure and impair blood vessel reflexes), standing up for a while without moving much, and possibly a heavy meal (sometimes eating can divert blood to the digestive system and briefly lower brain blood flow). The combination is enough to cause what you experienced even in a young, healthy person.

ItÂ’s reassuring that you recovered quickly, remembered everything before and after, and had no neurological symptoms like weakness, confusion, or prolonged disorientation. That makes something like multiple sclerosis (MS) extremely unlikely Â— MS typically presents with more chronic, progressive neurological issues over time, not sudden fainting episodes.","Fainted the other night... should I be worried?

Passing out, or syncope, can be caused by many things, including dehydration, low blood sugar, changes in blood pressure, and alcohol consumption. Alcohol can cause changes in heart rate and blood pressure, and it can also lead to dehydration, which might have contributed to your episode of fainting. 

However, it's also possible that the fainting episode was unrelated to your alcohol consumption and was instead due to another underlying condition. For example, certain heart conditions can cause fainting, as can neurological conditions like epilepsy or multiple sclerosis. Of course, these are more serious (and also more rare) possibilities.

If you're feeling well now, and you don't have any other symptoms, it's likely that your fainting spell was a one-off event. However, if you experience any further episodes, or if you have other symptoms (like chest pain, difficulty breathing, or seizures), you should seek medical attention right away. 

Regardless, it would be a good idea to mention this to your primary care physician at your next check-up, just to make sure there's no underlying condition that needs to be addressed. 

Please remember to drink responsibly and stay hydrated especially when consuming alcohol.",7.5,3.0,2.37,3.35
7,Bug Bite or Should I see a Doctor?,"http://i.imgur.com/orRFLyX.jpg

Found this bump on my elbow today, looks like a bug bite and I have been out around parks and foresty areas lately, the only thing that concerns me is that when I squish it its softer than most bug bites, like more squishy whereas things like mosquito, fly, and wasp bites are usually kind of hard and painful to touch. Just want to get a second opinion, thanks!","I think your intuition is quite accurate. Most bites from insects are usually firm and indurated 2/2 inflammation; when you say it is squishy, it almost sounds more fluctuant like a potentially developing abscess. Regardless of what it may be, it doesn't seem to emergent or life threatening. I'd get a sharpie and outline the erythematous area where the redness meets your normal skin color and watch it for growth within the next day. Can you describe whether it is itchy or painful? My only concern would be if it begins to ulcerate, then I'd go seek care. Certain species of spiders have hemolytic toxins that can cause some pretty bad necrotic ulcers (e.g brown recluse bites) that can potentially become disfiguring if not managed early w/ debriedement.","Thanks for reaching out about this Â— I understand finding something new on your skin can be concerning, especially after spending time outdoors. I wasn't able to view the image directly through the link you provided, but based on your description Â— a soft, squishy bump on the elbow that appeared after outdoor exposure Â— I can share some general information that might help guide your next steps.

A soft, squishy bump that resembles a bug bite could indeed be a simple insect bite or localized allergic reaction, especially if it's not overly painful, red, or swollen. Sometimes, bug bites (especially from mosquitoes or other small insects) can create a softer swelling if fluid builds up under the skin without a lot of inflammation.

However, there are a few things to keep in mind:

If the bump becomes increasingly red, hot, painful, or hardens, it could be developing into an infection like a skin abscess.

If you notice a bullseye pattern (red ring around a pale center), especially given your mention of forested areas, it's important to be cautious about tick bites and the early signs of Lyme disease.

If it stays soft, doesnÂ’t grow larger, and gradually fades over the next few days, it's most likely a mild localized reaction that will resolve on its own.

If you experience systemic symptoms like fever, chills, muscle aches, or spreading rash, you should seek medical attention promptly.

Since the bump feels softer than typical bug bites, that isn't necessarily alarming by itself Â— but it's a good idea to monitor it closely over the next 24Â–48 hours. Keep the area clean, avoid scratching it, and you could apply a cold compress if there's mild swelling or irritation.

Because I can't examine it directly, I would strongly recommend that if the bump changes in size, appearance, becomes painful, or if youÂ’re at all unsure, you should have it evaluated by a healthcare provider. They can determine if it's just a benign reaction or if it needs any specific treatment.","Bug Bite or Should I see a Doctor?

8,Few questions regarding my heart.,"Hey everyone here, thanks for being available!

Basic info:

~130lbs
~Age 21

Okay, so first of all, I've never felt my heart as much as I do now. It is extremely strange and sort of hard to describe.

One symptom is an occasional tightness in the region of my heart. It doesn't last very long, nor does it hurt very much, but it's enough for me to to notice and feel uncomfortable.

Second, sometimes I feel it beating abnormally hard. I was a swimmer in high school, but it has been a while since I have regularly worked out. At this point, it just feels like it is beating too hard for what I am doing. This is seldom, but seems to accompany the tightness.

Third, it feels like it is beating too fast as well. Again, this is not all the time, but enough for me to notice.

I've read up on dehydration possibly causing these symptoms and I am trying to drink more water recently but I'm still feeling these them.

Thanks to all those out there who answer, and if you need any more info feel free to ask. I'd really like to hear some useful information before I decide if I want to go get it checked out.","There's more questions that need answering that would help a little bit. Especially demographics:
M/F, ethnicity. Do you have any nausea when these events occur? At any time did you feel like passing out? Is there anything you can think of that coincides w/ the tightness such as a trigger? Any recent new stressors in your life? Any medications you are currently on (lots of teens are overdiagnosed w/ ADD and are on amphetamines)? There's a bunch more, but Dvdrummer360 pretty much has the correct final answer regardless of what we help diagnose you with... you need a full workup. Could be anything that is causing what sounds like palpitations... anxiety, hyperthyroidism, etc.","Thank you for being so clear and open about what you're experiencing Â— it's understandable to feel concerned when something feels off with your heart. I'll walk you through some general thoughts based on what you've shared, but remember that this isn't medical advice, and it's very important to follow up with a healthcare provider if symptoms continue or worsen.

The symptoms you're describing Â— occasional tightness in the chest, awareness of your heartbeat (""palpitations""), and episodes where your heart feels like it's beating too fast or too hard Â— can have a variety of causes. Some possibilities include:

Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance: As you mentioned, dehydration can definitely lead to palpitations and an exaggerated heartbeat sensation. Low levels of electrolytes like potassium, magnesium, or calcium can contribute as well.

Anxiety or stress: These are common culprits and can cause noticeable heart sensations even when at rest. Often, people with anxiety become more attuned to their heartbeats, making them feel stronger or faster.

Deconditioning: Since you haven't been exercising regularly since high school swimming, your cardiovascular fitness might have declined somewhat, which can make your heart work harder during basic activities, leading to more noticeable beats.

Caffeine, alcohol, or stimulants: These can increase heart rate and palpitations, even in people without underlying heart issues.

Heart rhythm issues (arrhythmias): Less commonly in someone your age, but still possible, there could be a benign rhythm disturbance (like supraventricular tachycardia or premature beats) causing these symptoms.

Structural heart issues: Rare in young, healthy people, but occasionally conditions like mitral valve prolapse or other congenital abnormalities can cause palpitations or mild chest discomfort.

While the tightness you describe doesn't sound typical for a heart attack (which would usually involve crushing, heavy chest pain lasting several minutes, possibly with arm or jaw pain), any chest symptoms and noticeable heart irregularities should be evaluated Â— especially if they are new, persistent, or worsening.

It's reassuring that the symptoms seem mild and intermittent, but it's still wise to get a basic medical evaluation: a physical exam, a resting ECG (electrocardiogram), and possibly some basic blood tests to check electrolytes and thyroid function. These are simple, non-invasive, and could rule out many potential issues quickly.

In the meantime, keeping well hydrated, minimizing caffeine and alcohol, getting consistent sleep, and monitoring your symptoms are all good steps.

Since you seem proactive about your health, would you like me to also suggest a few points you could mention or questions you could ask if you decide to visit a doctor? It can help make sure you cover all the key concerns!","Few questions regarding my heart.

Should she?","It is possible that it is poison oak, but it's more likely something else just based off my experience with lots of poison oak in the years I was on search and rescue for our county. Was she ever exposed to poison oak before? Because the reaction to poison oak is a type IV hypersensitivity (it just means that she needs to have prior exposure for her body to make cells that will mount a response during the second exposure). If this is her first time ever even possibly touching the urushiol oils of poison oak, then her body is naive and would not be able to mount a response. It is still definitely possible that it is some form of contact dermatitis. If it has not diminished by a week from now I would say it wouldn't hurt to get it checked out!","Thank you for describing the situation Â— and I appreciate that you're looking out for her. I wasnÂ’t able to view the image directly from the link, but based on your description, I can definitely give you some general guidance.

A rash that has expanded over a week, even if it started small and skin-colored, can be concerning depending on a few key features. Since you mentioned you were out in the woods, there are a few possibilities to consider:

Insect bites (mosquito, spider, chigger) can cause delayed reactions, sometimes enlarging over days.

Contact dermatitis from plants like poison ivy, oak, or sumac can cause itchy, blistering rashes that evolve over a week.

Tick bites, especially concerning for Lyme disease, can cause a rash that slowly enlarges over several days. The early Lyme rash is called erythema migrans and often appears as a slowly expanding red area that can sometimes have a ""bullseye"" appearance Â— but not always.

Given that the rash has grown and itÂ’s been a full week, it would be a good idea for her to see a doctor. Even if it's not painful or intensely symptomatic, rashes associated with outdoor exposure Â— especially those that change over time Â— should be evaluated, particularly to rule out Lyme disease or an infection. Early treatment of Lyme (if that's the cause) is very effective with antibiotics, but itÂ’s important not to delay if itÂ’s suspected.

Additionally, if she's experiencing any fever, fatigue, joint aches, or headache, those symptoms would further strengthen the need to seek medical attention.

I strongly encourage her to have it looked at Â— even if she feels fine otherwise Â— just to be cautious. Many clinics can assess a rash quickly, and early diagnosis can prevent bigger problems later.","Strange rash, I suppose, on my girlfriend's leg

While I cannot give a diagnosis, I can definitely help you think through what might be happening and suggest reasonable next steps you can take on your own, while still strongly encouraging a professional evaluation when you are able.

From your description Â— chronic lower abdominal pain, difficulty urinating, and a history of food intolerances Â— a few broad possibilities come to mind:

Bladder issues, such as interstitial cystitis (a chronic inflammation of the bladder) can cause pain that feels like it's in the lower abdomen, worsens with bladder filling, and often comes with urinary urgency but difficulty actually urinating.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), particularly if it's post-infectious or diet-sensitive, could explain chronic abdominal discomfort thatÂ’s hard to pinpoint and fluctuates with diet.

Food intolerances or sensitivities, like a worsening soy intolerance, could contribute to intestinal inflammation, but they typically cause symptoms more tied to eating (like bloating, diarrhea, or cramping after meals).

Pelvic floor dysfunction can cause both lower abdominal discomfort and difficulty urinating, though this is harder to self-diagnose.

Less commonly, diverticular disease or low-grade inflammatory bowel disease could be possibilities, but these usually come with changes in bowel habits (diarrhea, blood, etc.).

Steps you can reasonably take on your own for now:
Diet review: Continue to avoid soy (and any foods that seem to worsen your symptoms). You might also try a basic elimination diet to see if cutting down on other common irritants (like gluten, dairy, high-fat foods, caffeine) helps.

Hydration: Make sure you're drinking enough water Â— sometimes concentrating urine can irritate the bladder further.

Bladder habits: Avoid ""holding"" urine for long periods and avoid bladder irritants like caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods.

Gentle movement: Walking and light exercise can help gut motility and reduce pelvic tension.

Symptom diary: Keep a daily record of what you eat, your symptoms, and urination patterns Â— this could be very useful if/when you do see a doctor later.

However, if you notice any of the following, you should seek medical attention immediately even if itÂ’s difficult financially:

Blood in your urine or stool

Severe or worsening pain

Unintentional weight loss

Fevers or night sweats

Inability to urinate despite the urge

I realize that affordability is a real concern, but some areas offer low-cost or sliding-scale clinics, and urgent care centers sometimes charge much less than emergency rooms for evaluations of abdominal or urinary issues.","Abdominal pain for months

What are your demographics? If you are between 16-25 yo the chances of it being mono is much higher than it being strep throat. Both mono and strep can have those white blotches (exudates) and both present very similarly. Do you have any abdominal tenderness especially in the left upper quadrant? I highly recommend you to avoid contact sports for at least 2-3 wks or until your doc lets you know what he thinks. People infected with mono have splenomegally (enlarged spleen) and are prone to splenic ruptures if even a little rough with their body.,"Thanks for describing everything so clearly Â— it really sounds like you're going through a rough time with this. Based on your symptoms Â— worsening throat pain, massive swelling, difficulty eating, and no improvement after several days on a Z-pak Â— this does sound serious enough that you should seek further medical attention, even though I completely understand your concern about cost.

While it initially sounded like bacterial pharyngitis (like strep), a few things are concerning now:

Z-pak (azithromycin) sometimes isn't strong enough against severe strep infections or certain other bacteria.

If it's not bacterial strep, another common cause could be infectious mononucleosis (caused by the Epstein-Barr virus). Mono often causes severe tonsillar swelling, white patches, extreme throat pain, and it typically does not respond to antibiotics.

Other possibilities could include an abscess forming around the tonsils (called peritonsillar abscess), which can cause significant swelling and might need drainage.

Severe cases can, rarely, affect breathing Â— so if you notice trouble breathing, drooling because you can't swallow, or severe difficulty swallowing even liquids, you need urgent care immediately.

Right now, since youÂ’re worsening despite treatment, you really do need to be evaluated again Â— at the very least to make sure no abscess is forming or that your airway isn't at risk.

As for managing the cost:

Many hospitals and urgent care clinics offer financial assistance or charity care if you explain you're between insurance coverage.

Some areas have walk-in clinics with capped visit prices, which might be much cheaper than a hospital ER.

Key advice: Don't delay seeking help Â— worsening throat swelling can become an emergency. It's much safer to get checked out, even with temporary financial hardship, than to risk a serious complication.","Strep Throat(?) not reacting to Antibiotics, throat extremely swollen.

Approximately 8 days ago, I started having a sore throat. Very minor, just enough to notice, assumed it was a cold. Fast forward to Tuesday (3 days ago), I woke up with extreme discomfort in my throat, headache, stomach ache, and when I used a flashlight to look down my throat, I could see some white blotches on my tonsils. I go to the doctors, he does a rapid strep test, which did not register for strep, so he sent a throat culture to the lab. But he said it was probably strep, so he prescribed  Z-pak for me, as I am allergic to Penicillin.

It has only gotten worse. While the stomach and head ache's are gone,my throat is very swollen, my uvula and tonsils have become one swollen, sore covered mass, and I cannot eat anything remotely solid. I just took the 4th set of Z-pak pills (2 pills, once a day). Doc was suppose to call yesterday with lab results, I will be calling today.

To make things even more difficult, I'm am currently transitioning between healthcare providers, and I found out on Tuesday that coverage from my first provider has already ceased, and the new one does not start until August 1st. I'm almost hesitant to go in again, and get hit with a huge bill if it is something worse.

Any ideas?","I'm an AI, not a doctor, but I can suggest that this could potentially be a case of a viral infection, such as mono or flu, which won't respond to antibiotics. It could also be that the bacteria causing your infection is resistant to the Z-Pak. You might have an abscess, which would require drainage. In case of severe pain, dehydration, or difficulty breathing, you should seek immediate medical attention. Please contact your healthcare provider right away for advice.",8.5,7.5,7.29,4.95
13,Are these symptoms related?,"I don't have insurance at the moment because it won't kick in until September but something is worrying me...

I popped a vein in my right wrist a couple days ago by trying to bang in my daughter headboard that was coming apart. Immediately my vein began swelling and you could see that is was bleeding, now it is really bruised about 3 inches all around my wrist. Yesterday (the day after the incident) I got a HORRIBLE headache. I have never had pain like that before, I laid down when I went to bed and was awoken by the pain twice. I took 3 ibuprofen and it did not help at all. The pain was mainly above my eyes and across my forehead. I am wondering if these things are related or if there is any cause for concern... 

Thank you for any help or advice you can give.","Sorry for getting back to you so long after the event occurred, but do you still have said pain in your head?","Thanks for reaching out Â— I can understand why you'd be concerned, especially dealing with an injury and then a severe headache afterward. Based on what you described, the injury to your wrist vein Â— causing local swelling and bruising Â— sounds like a localized hematoma (a blood collection under the skin), which is typically not dangerous if it's limited to the arm and there's no ongoing swelling, numbness, or discoloration spreading down to the hand. This kind of vein injury would usually not cause a headache unless there were some much more serious systemic issues, which doesn't sound likely here based on your description.

However, the severe headache you had Â— waking you up at night, unrelieved by ibuprofen, and described as pain youÂ’ve Â“never had beforeÂ” Â— is more concerning. Severe new headaches, especially if they are different from anything you've experienced before, are a red flag and should be evaluated by a doctor. While it's unlikely related to the wrist injury directly, headaches of that intensity can sometimes signal more serious conditions like migraines, intracranial bleeding (rare without head trauma), or other neurological issues.

Bottom line:

The wrist vein injury sounds like it's healing (keep an eye on it for excessive swelling, pain, or numbness).

The headache, however, should be evaluated, even though I know you're between insurance coverages. Severe, new headaches that wake you from sleep are something doctors take seriously.

If cost is a concern, you could consider:

Visiting an urgent care rather than an ER (often lower cost).

Asking about cash-pay discounts Â— many places offer significant discounts if you pay out-of-pocket.

Some nonprofit hospitals offer financial assistance or charity care programs if you explain your situation.

It's better to be safe and get checked than risk missing something serious.","Are these symptoms related?

15,Easy bruising and petechiae,"I've been having this problem for a while, I often find tiny red spots on my skin, especially on my bra line.Also I bruise much easier, ex: I was bitten by a mosquito and after I scratched it for a while I developed tiny red spots and small bruises in that place.I don't have any obvious problems.My thrombocytes are fine, hemoglobin is fine, liver as well and my blood clotting doesn't seem affected, at least if I consider the blood clotting tests I've made.Is there anything else I should check or maybe I can let this go?20,F.",Can you please tell us what blood clotting tests you have done and the results? ,"Thank you for describing everything so clearly Â— I can see youÂ’ve already been very proactive in getting key tests done. Based on what youÂ’ve shared Â— easy bruising, petechiae (tiny red spots), normal platelet count, normal hemoglobin, normal liver function, and normal clotting tests Â— itÂ’s reassuring that the major, more dangerous causes of bleeding issues have largely been ruled out.

There are a few possibilities to consider:

Mechanical causes: Friction from clothing (like along the bra line) can cause small blood vessels to break under the skin, especially if your skin is sensitive or if you've had minor trauma like scratching.

Minor capillary fragility: Some people naturally have slightly more fragile capillaries that can rupture more easily with pressure or minor trauma. This can be harmless but can make petechiae and bruising more common.

Nutritional factors: Vitamin C deficiency (even mild) or vitamin K deficiency can sometimes cause easier bruising and petechiae. If your diet has been limited or inconsistent, this could be worth looking into.

Hormonal factors: Fluctuations in estrogen (especially in young women) can sometimes make the skin and vessels a bit more fragile.

Medications or supplements: If you are taking anything like aspirin, NSAIDs (like ibuprofen), fish oil, or herbal supplements (like ginkgo), they can sometimes slightly impair platelet function even if counts are normal.

Given everything you've done so far, and if you're not seeing large spontaneous bruises, bleeding gums, nosebleeds, or prolonged bleeding from cuts, itÂ’s probably safe to monitor for now without urgent concern. However, if you continue noticing more frequent bruising or petechiae in unusual places (like your face, torso, or legs without trauma), or if you develop new symptoms like fatigue, infections, or swollen lymph nodes, you should definitely follow up with a doctor Â— possibly a hematologist.

For now, making sure you get enough vitamin C, vitamin K, and maintaining a gentle skincare routine could help reduce minor vessel damage.","Easy bruising and petechiae

I've been having this problem for a while, I often find tiny red spots on my skin, especially on my bra line.Also I bruise much easier, ex: I was bitten by a mosquito and after I scratched it for a while I developed tiny red spots and small bruises in that place.I don't have any obvious problems.My thrombocytes are fine, hemoglobin is fine, liver as well and my blood clotting doesn't seem affected, at least if I consider the blood clotting tests I've made.Is there anything else I should check or maybe I can let this go?20,F.","Easy bruising and petechiae can be caused by numerous conditions, both minor and serious. It's good that you've already checked your platelets, hemoglobin, liver function, and clotting factors, as problems with any of these can lead to bruising and petechiae. 

However, there are still many other potential causes. It might be due to something as simple as your skin being very sensitive or thin. It could also be due to certain medications, supplements, or dietary factors. For example, aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anticoagulants, corticosteroids, certain supplements like ginkgo, and even excessive alcohol or caffeine can all increase the risk of bruising and petechiae.

More serious potential causes include various types of vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels), certain infections, and even some types of cancer. However, these are usually accompanied by other symptoms.

Without knowing more about your situation, it's hard to say what might be causing your symptoms. It might be worth discussing this further with your doctor. They could consider other tests, such as looking for deficiencies in certain clotting factors that standard clotting tests might not pick up, or checking for signs of inflammation in your blood vessels. You should also let them know about any medications, supplements, or dietary factors that might be relevant.

It's a bit deep in.","If it is superficial, it is not really concerning as yes, it will over time come out on its own. If it is deep as you said, the main concern would be for infection as wood is a porous material and it would not be ideal to be left in a deep wound. Did you bleed at all when you got the splinter? If you did, I would consider it deep enough to be problematic and get a medical professional to remove it.","In general, small, shallow splinters can sometimes work their way out naturally over a few days as the skin sheds. However, deeper splinters, especially those fully embedded under the skin, often do not come out on their own and can instead cause inflammation, infection, or persistent pain if left untreated.

Since you said the splinter is a bit deep, the safer and more reliable approach would usually be to remove it sooner rather than later. Ideally, you'd gently use clean tweezers (sterilized with alcohol) to pull it out if any part is visible. If it's not accessible easily, sometimes soaking the area in warm water for 10Â–15 minutes a few times a day can help the skin soften and push the splinter closer to the surface. Using a sterilized needle to very gently open the skin right over the splinter can be an option, but it should be done very carefully to avoid injury or infection.

If you leave it in and notice redness, swelling, warmth, pus, or increasing pain, itÂ’s a sign of infection and you should definitely have it evaluated by a healthcare provider.

Bottom line: while very small splinters can sometimes come out on their own, for deeper ones, itÂ’s better to remove them carefully now to avoid complications.","Do splinters come out on their own?

17,Battling BV,"I am 23/f. The only medication I am on is birth control (Gildess FE 1/20). Any help to get my vagina back to normal would be VERY much appreciated.

In April I went to the Gyno for a yellow discharge and slight fishy odor. My main doctor was not available so I saw a PA. She took a culture and told me it looked like BV. She asked if I had a new partner recently and I said yes back in March I became sexually active with a new boyfriend. This is when my problems started occurring. She didn't think it was an STD but I asked to get tested regardless. The culture came back positive for BV and the STD test came back negative for everything.

She prescribed me some tablets to take over a 2 day period that I cannot remember the name of. There was no change from taking these so she prescribed metro gel to use every night for 5 nights. This helped a bit, but I got a yeast infection as is common after using this. So she prescribed 2 fluconazole tablets to take over 2 days to get rid of the yeast infection. The yeast infection went away but just a few days later the yellow discharge returned.

I went in the office again and saw my regular doctor. She took another culture (came back P for BV) and prescribed me metro gel for 10 days and went ahead and gave me the fluconazole tablets for the yeast infection that would occur after. A few days after finishing this the yellow discharge returned. (Those few days it was gone was absolute heaven)

I emailed the doctor and she prescribed 500mg Metro tablets to take every 12 hours for 7 days. I am on the last day of this and the discharge has been constant throughout. So I know I will have to go back in.

Is there any hope?!?

*I changed soap to Dove
*I have made sure I am washing properly (just washing the lips)
*I stopped taking as many baths (I shower typically 2X a day)
*Started drinking more water
*Started eating a cleaner diet and lost some weight

*I started eating yogurt every morning
*I started taking a probiotic
*I tried taking Pro-B probiotic for vaginal health but saw no change and it's expensive so I didn't buy another bottle.
*I've started exercising more (I'm not as good about this one)
*I make sure my partner and I are clean before we have intercourse which has of course been rare since this started. (We don't use condoms as I am on BC he also pulls out as to not disrupt my ph)


I am very scared this isn't going to go away. **I feel absolutely disgusting!** Should I get tested for STD's again? They seem to only be prescribing the one drug. Is this the only one available for this problem? Are there any other steps I can take for vaginal health? I hope I'm not forgetting anything.

Thank you in advance!

I'm posting this for a second time because the first didn't show up even after 2 hours.","From my OB/Gyn rotation I learned that the vagina is a very precarious environment and anything that may skew it in one direction will cause an overgrowth of a different organism. A lot of the things you listed are good things to try to get the environment of your vagina stabilized, but I'm more curious as to what caused it in the first place. From my understanding it was the new BF correct? My BIGGEST question to you is has he been treated with the metronidazole also? Your partner MUST be treated in cases of BV as he may be an asymptomatic carrier. You can keep treating yourself with the metro (and it seems to work as you have had periods of clarity), but it will keep coming back. Metronidazole and clindamycin are the two drugs most commonly used for BV, so your doctor is right on track. If he has not been treated yet, please start there. Keep us updated on your progress and goodluck.","Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly Â— youÂ’re clearly being very responsible and proactive, and itÂ’s completely understandable that you're frustrated and worried. What youÂ’re going through is unfortunately very common with recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV), and it can absolutely be exhausting to deal with, both physically and emotionally.

HereÂ’s a careful breakdown based on everything you shared:

First, BV can be stubborn and recurrences are common, even when treated correctly. Metronidazole (oral and gel) is the standard first-line treatment, but not the only option. Other options include:

Clindamycin vaginal cream or oral clindamycin (a different antibiotic that sometimes works better for certain bacteria).

Secnidazole (Solosec), a newer antibiotic thatÂ’s a one-dose treatment for BV.

Some doctors also use longer-term suppressive therapy, like using metrogel twice a week for a few months to prevent recurrence once it's cleared.

Based on your history, it sounds like you might have a few factors:

Incomplete eradication of the bacteria despite multiple rounds of treatment.

Possible imbalance of vaginal flora that isn't restoring itself properly after treatment (despite the probiotics Â— which help, but sometimes aren't enough alone).

Sexual activity can reintroduce bacteria, even from a steady partner, especially without condom use. (Even though BV isnÂ’t an STD, it can be triggered by sexual activity.)

Regarding retesting for STDs:
Yes, it would be reasonable to repeat STD testing, particularly for trichomoniasis, which can sometimes mimic or worsen BV and isnÂ’t always caught with standard tests unless specifically ordered. Also, mycoplasma or ureaplasma infections (less commonly tested for) can contribute to ongoing symptoms.","Battling BV

It sounds like you're doing all the right things to help your situation. You're on the right track with the cotton underwear, proper washing, and dietary changes.

BV is caused by a disruption in the normal bacterial balance in your vagina. This can be caused by a number of things, including new sexual partners, douching, and even the use of certain types of birth control. You might want to discuss with your doctor about possibly switching your birth control, as some types can increase your risk of BV.

There are other treatment options for BV outside of metronidazole, including clindamycin and tinidazole. If metronidazole isn't working for you, it might be worth discussing these alternatives with your doctor. 

In terms of probiotics, look out for ones that contain the strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14. These strains have been shown to be effective in restoring the normal bacterial balance in the vagina.

Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself. BV is a common issue for many women and it's not a reflection of your cleanliness or health. It's just a disruption in your body's normal balance and it can be treated. Keep working with your doctor and stay positive.",7.5,7.5,7.43,7.57

I would suggest getting checked out as your worsening headache could really be nothing at all.... or it could be a subdural hematoma building in your head status post landing on your head. Again, trauma cases are hard to discuss as the kinetics and mechanism of your injury makes it difficult to assess.","ItÂ’s understandable to be worried, especially after reading alarming possibilities online, but based on what you described, it sounds much more likely that your neck pain is due to a musculoskeletal strain or minor injury from the wakeboarding accident rather than something serious like cancer. Wakeboarding can easily cause whiplash-like injuries, muscle strains, or even minor ligament sprains, especially if you landed hard or awkwardly. The fact that the pain increased after certain movements (like tilting your head back) also supports a mechanical cause, not something systemic like cancer, which typically presents much more subtly and over a longer time. However, because your pain increased significantly, you have a headache associated with neck movement, and the injury involved a fall, it would be wise to seek evaluation by a healthcare provider to rule out anything more serious like a concussion, cervical strain, or, rarely, a more significant neck injury. Try to limit neck movement, continue icing as needed, and avoid self-diagnosing based on internet searches.

4. Peripheral Artery Disease: This can cause black spots due to poor blood circulation in the legs.

5. Diabetes: In rare cases, black spots on the feet can be a sign of diabetic dermopathy or necrobiosis lipoidica, which are skin conditions associated with diabetes.

It's important to consult with a healthcare professional to get a proper diagnosis as some of these conditions can be serious and require immediate treatment. They can examine your skin, ask about your medical history, and if necessary, perform tests or biopsies to determine the cause of the black spots.",5.0,5.0,2.17,3.74
20,Father has swollen lymph nodes in his groin area.,According to [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/swollen-lymph-nodes-topic-overview) this may be due to melanoma. If my father has an irregular mole on his cheek and back could the swollen lymph nodes be a result of melanoma?,"To help you with this, we need much more information. Demographics to begin with and more details about when the swelling started, any other problems, etc. For example right now there's about 15 differentials I can think of off the top of my head that can be causing swollen lymph nodes in the groin area. It can be the most common and benign cause = manscaping/ladyscaping (shaving in the general area) to the melanoma you suggested.","It's very thoughtful of you to look into this carefully. Swollen lymph nodes in the groin area can happen for a number of reasons Â— often from infections, minor injuries, or other benign causes Â— but they can also, more rarely, be associated with cancers like melanoma.

If your father has irregular moles on his cheek and back and now has swelling in the groin lymph nodes, it raises a reasonable concern because melanoma can spread (metastasize) to lymph nodes. That said, **the location matters**: moles on the face and back typically first spread to the lymph nodes in the neck or armpit, **not usually the groin**. Swollen groin lymph nodes are more often linked to infections or issues involving the lower body (legs, lower abdomen, or genitals).

While melanoma is a serious condition and definitely should be ruled out, especially if the moles are concerning, it's also very possible that the groin swelling is unrelated. It's important your father have a full evaluation by a healthcare professional soon. They may recommend a skin examination, possibly a biopsy of the moles, and possibly imaging or a biopsy of the lymph node if needed.

This information is not medical advice Â— itÂ’s essential your father consults with a doctor promptly to get a full, professional evaluation. Would you like me to help you list a few important questions you (or your father) could ask the doctor during the visit?","Father has swollen lymph nodes in his groin area.

If my father has an irregular mole on his cheek and back could the swollen lymph nodes be a result of melanoma?","While it's possible for swollen lymph nodes in the groin area to be a result of melanoma, it's not necessarily the only explanation. Swollen lymph nodes can occur due to a wide range of conditions, including infections, immune system disorders, and other types of cancers. 

If your father has an irregular mole on his cheek and back, it's important to get them checked out by a doctor, especially if they've changed in size, shape or color. These can be signs of melanoma. However, melanoma can spread to the lymph nodes, it's more common for it to spread to lymph nodes in the same region of the body where the cancer started. If the melanoma started on the cheek or back, it's less likely (but not impossible) for it to spread to the lymph nodes in the groin.

Regardless, any swollen lymph nodes, especially if they're accompanied by other potential signs of cancer like irregular moles, should be evaluated by a healthcare professional to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.",7.5,7.5,7.48,7.58
21,Throbbing head pain in various situations,"Basically the only thing wrong with me is that I get head pain whenever I stand up or when I sneeze, clench my teeth, or anything else similar. I suspected high blood pressure but I went to the doctor and it was 120/75. The doctor suggested it was from overexertion because I was on vacation in the New England area and did a lot of walking which I'm not used to and possibly a cold virus as well. I was told to take normal doses of Advil, which I did. I was also told it should be gone in a couple of days, but that time has elapsed and it has actually gotten worse when the Advil wears off. Any thoughts?","Can you provide some demographics? Younger women can develop idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) which can be exacerbated with sneezing... it's not very common, but it's also not that rare of a disorder....","Thank you for explaining your situation so clearly. ItÂ’s definitely frustrating when symptoms donÂ’t improve as expected. Based on your description Â— throbbing head pain triggered by standing up, sneezing, clenching your teeth, and similar actions Â— it raises a few possibilities. One potential cause could be something called a **primary exertional headache** or **cough headache**, which is typically benign but can be very uncomfortable. However, when these headaches worsen over time and don't respond well to simple pain relievers like Advil, doctors become more cautious and start considering less common but more serious causes.

One important thing to rule out would be something like **intracranial pressure changes** Â— in very rare cases, issues like a **cerebrospinal fluid leak**, **chiari malformation**, or even **venous sinus issues** could cause similar symptoms. These conditions can make head pressure and pain worse with standing, straining, or other exertion. The fact that it's worsening rather than improving suggests it would be smart to **go back to your doctor** and let them know specifically that the pattern has changed. They might recommend getting imaging (like an MRI) to rule out anything more serious.

Again, this isnÂ’t medical advice, and you should definitely consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis. I would encourage you to advocate for yourself and let them know very clearly that the pain has progressed, is positional, and is not responding to over-the-counter medication as expected.

You might be experiencing what's called a ""positional headache,"" which can occur due to changes in body position such as standing up or bending over. These headaches can be caused by various conditions including low or high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, blood vessel issues, or sinus problems.

It's also possible that you're experiencing exertional headaches, which can be triggered by physical activities such as sneezing, coughing, or clenching your teeth. 

However, it's important to note that these are just possibilities and not a diagnosis. Headaches can be caused by a wide range of conditions, some of which can be serious. If your symptoms have worsened despite following your doctor's advice, you should seek medical attention again. It's important to describe your symptoms in detail, including their onset, frequency, location, and any accompanying symptoms.

Takes decades to get an appointment with my doctor. I'm kind of just hoping it'll clear up, but if anyone has any clue?",I agree with Lizziekyroshiu that it looks fungal. That whiter line that demarcates the erythema from your unaffected skin is typical of fungal infections.,"I understand you're looking for some guidance while waiting to see a doctor. Based on your description Â— raw, pink/red skin around the anus and scrotum that has improved somewhat with Sudocrem Â— several possibilities come to mind. Common causes include **skin irritation** (from sweating, friction, tight clothing, or prolonged moisture), **intertrigo** (a skin inflammation in warm, moist areas), or a **mild fungal or yeast infection**, which is very common in the groin area due to heat and humidity. Sudocrem, which contains zinc oxide, can help by providing a barrier and reducing irritation, which might explain why youÂ’re seeing some improvement.

Less commonly, it could be related to **eczema**, **contact dermatitis** (a reaction to soaps, laundry detergents, or other products), or **mild bacterial infection**. It's a good sign that it's getting better rather than worse, but if the area becomes more painful, starts oozing, develops a foul smell, or doesn't continue improving, you should prioritize getting medical attention, even at an urgent care clinic if necessary.

This isnÂ’t medical advice, and it's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis. Meanwhile, keeping the area clean, dry, avoiding tight clothing, and continuing gentle care (like with Sudocrem or a similar barrier cream) is usually safe until you're evaluated.

Would you like me to suggest a few safe over-the-counter options you could consider while monitoring it?","Raw pink/red skin around anus/ballsack. This is better than yesterday, I put some sudocrem on it overnight. Any clues? [NSFW]

What could potentially be causing this, and is there anything she can do, other than continuing to pester her GP?",Please list some demographics and any other additional information you have. Does she have any other problems with cramping elsewhere or is it just localized to her calf? Is it in both legs or just one?,"ItÂ’s completely understandable to feel frustrated when persistent symptoms arenÂ’t getting answers, especially when it affects daily life like this. Chronic calf cramping can be caused by a wide range of things, and while diabetes is one important condition to rule out (which she has), there are several other possibilities that might be worth exploring:

* **Electrolyte imbalances** (low potassium, magnesium, calcium, or sodium) can cause frequent muscle cramps, especially if her diet, hydration, or activity levels fluctuate.
* **Circulatory issues**, such as peripheral artery disease (PAD), can sometimes cause cramping, especially if it's worsened by walking or standing.
* **Nerve compression** (such as from a back problem like a herniated disc) could also cause leg pain or cramps without clear trauma.
* **Medication side effects** (if she's taking any regular prescriptions, like statins or diuretics) could also contribute.
* **Muscle fatigue** or **overuse injuries**, even subtle ones from posture or exercise patterns, sometimes trigger repeated cramps.
* Much more rarely, underlying **metabolic** or **neuromuscular disorders** could be a factor, but these are uncommon and usually come with other noticeable symptoms.

Given that her twin doesnÂ’t have these issues, it might hint toward an environmental, lifestyle, or isolated health factor, not a purely genetic one.

Since basic GP visits havenÂ’t helped, it might be worthwhile to specifically request:

* A full **blood panel** (electrolytes, kidney function, thyroid function, magnesium levels).
* Possibly a **vascular exam** if circulation is a concern.
* A **neurological evaluation** if there are any signs of numbness, weakness, or persistent pain beyond cramps.

In the meantime, she could try keeping a symptom diary Â— noting when cramps occur, how severe they are, and any patterns like dehydration, exercise, certain foods, or stress. Staying well-hydrated, gently stretching the calves, and ensuring a balanced intake of key minerals might help manage symptoms.

Of course, this isnÂ’t medical advice, and I strongly encourage her to continue following up with a healthcare professional Â— or even seek a second opinion or referral to a specialist like a neurologist or vascular doctor if needed.

Please take her to a medical professional for a definitive diagnosis. 

Calf cramps can be caused by a variety of factors including dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or certain medications. They can also be associated with physical overexertion, poor circulation, or nerve compression. 

Here are a few things she could try:

1. Hydration: Ensure she's drinking enough fluids, dehydration is a common cause of muscle cramps.

2. Balanced diet: Ensure she's getting enough minerals like potassium, calcium, and magnesium in her diet. These are essential for muscle function and their deficiency can lead to cramps.

3. Stretching and exercise: Regular, light exercise can help improve circulation and reduce cramping. Stretching before bed may also help prevent cramps.

4. Warm baths or heating pads: These can help relax tense muscles and may alleviate cramping.

5. Over-the-counter medications: Non-prescription medicine like pain relievers or muscle relaxants may help, but should only be used as directed and with the approval of a healthcare provider.

If the cramps persist, she should definitely consult with her GP again or maybe get a second opinion from another doctor.

He is 50 years old, fit as an ox (bike commutes daily), eats healthy, has taken a multivitamin and a baby aspirin daily for decades, is on no other meds, and is in otherwise excellent health -- except for chronic, unexplained anemia. He has had the anemia for at least a decade.  About 5 years ago, his GP sent him for endoscopy to rule out internal bleeding. Then she put him on a course of B12 injections, that did nothing. However a few months later, his anemia then improved enough that there was no further follow up and he was okay. This year he went back for a routine check up and his anemia is back, and worse than ever. He had another endoscopy and a colonscopy. His GI tract is normal, no gluten intolerance, nothing. His B12 and folate is also normal, and his GP no longer thinks it's related to diet/B12 deficiency. She has referred him to a hematologist. She has run a ton of blood tests, everything is normal, except for his hemoglobin, which is below normal. She is also concerned with his low total blood count. His WBC and platelets are within normal range - but at the very end of low.

Are liver and kidney function tests okay?

What are his ethnic origins?","It's completely natural to be worried, but there are many potential causes for your husband's anemia that are far less serious than aplastic anemia. Chronic, unexplained anemia can often be due to things like slow, hidden blood loss (even if endoscopies were normal), anemia of chronic disease related to low-grade inflammation, or age-related changes in bone marrow function, which are common and often manageable. Deficiencies in minerals like copper or zinc Â— less commonly tested Â— can also mimic serious blood disorders but are easy to correct once identified. Even long-term baby aspirin use can contribute to minor, unnoticed bleeding and bruising, particularly in active individuals. The fact that his white cells and platelets are still within the normal range, and that heÂ’s stayed active for years, strongly suggests a slower, less aggressive condition rather than something catastrophic. It's a good sign that he is now seeing a hematologist, who will be able to sort through these possibilities systematically.

Here are a few possibilities:

1. Iron-deficiency anemia: This is one of the most common types of anemia, and can be caused by a diet low in iron, poor absorption of iron, or chronic bleeding. 

2. Anemia of chronic disease: Certain diseases â€” such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease and Crohn's disease â€” can interfere with the production of red blood cells, resulting in chronic anemia.

3. Vitamin-deficiency anemia: Besides B12, your body needs folate and vitamin C to produce enough healthy red blood cells. A diet lacking these and other key nutrients can cause decreased red blood cell production.

4. Hemolytic anemia: This type of anemia occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than bone marrow can replace them. Certain blood diseases can cause increased blood cell destruction.

5. Sickle cell anemia: This inherited and potentially serious condition is a type of anemia that's caused by a defective form of hemoglobin that forces red blood cells to assume an abnormal crescent (sickle) shape.

It's also possible that his anemia is idiopathic, meaning it has no identifiable cause. This is more common than you might think, but it doesn't make the condition any less important to manage.

Regarding the bruising, this could be due to a number of factors, such as thinning skin due to aging, certain medications, or even a vitamin C deficiency.

Significant shoulder, neck, and back pain after a tetanus booster, while uncommon, can happen if the vaccine irritates the nearby muscles, nerves, or even the bursa (a fluid-filled sac that cushions joints). This could lead to a condition called **shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA)**, where inflammation causes intense pain and stiffness. It's typically not dangerous but can be very painful. Symptoms often peak within a few days to a week and can take several more weeks to fully resolve. Heat (not ice) is usually better for muscular injuries once they are inflamed, as it promotes blood flow and eases stiffness. Gentle movement, anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen (if safe for you), and avoiding complete immobilization can help speed recovery. However, if you cannot move without severe pain, or if symptoms continue to worsen, itÂ’s important to see a healthcare provider to rule out more serious issues like nerve involvement or a rotator cuff injury.

Since you didnÂ’t include a photo or detailed description, IÂ’ll keep this general: when a toddler suddenly develops a new rash, swelling, discoloration, or unusual mark, the possibilities can range from common, benign issues like **viral rashes** or **hives** (especially after mild infections), to rarer conditions like **petechiae**, **vasculitis**, or **insect bites** causing allergic reactions. Some less common but important possibilities include **erythema multiforme** (a skin reaction sometimes triggered by infections) or **hand-foot-and-mouth disease**, depending on the appearance and pattern.

The marks on my jaw (you can sort of see it in all of them, but ""three"" focuses on it Ã¢Â€Â“ albeit, a bit washed out from the light) are similar to the one on my cheek. Some dead skin/sort-of-a-scab flaked off today leaving some fresh-pink skin.

The facial hair is sort of a new thing, so I thought they might be caused by some irritation/ingrown hairs, but that doesn't seem quite right from my previous experiences. I also have about two marks (similar to the stuff on my jaw I suppose) that might be related or simply caused by the irritation of my beard. 

Any help would be seriously appreciated.","The ones in the beard look like Tinea, a fungal infection. 
And I bet that the bigger one is also fungal, but made worse by scratching.

You should go to a GP for some anti fungal ointment...","From your description, it sounds like what you're seeing could be **mild skin infections**, likely caused by **folliculitis** Â— inflammation of the hair follicles, often triggered by new facial hair growth, shaving irritation, or even minor trauma like scratching. Folliculitis can start looking like small pimples, scabs, or red bumps and sometimes progresses if bacteria like *Staphylococcus* get involved. The tight feeling of the skin around the area and the slow healing you describe are consistent with this.

Another possibility could be a **minor staph infection** (like impetigo if the skin isn't properly scabbing) or **pseudofolliculitis barbae** (irritation and ingrown hairs related to beard growth), though you noted it doesnÂ’t feel quite like typical ingrown hairs youÂ’ve had before. Less likely but possible would be a **bug bite** or even just a **local inflammatory reaction** from the new beard irritating sensitive skin.

Since it seems to be spreading a bit and healing slowly, it would be a good idea to keep the area very clean, avoid further scratching, and consider applying a topical antibiotic ointment like bacitracin or mupirocin (available over-the-counter or by prescription, depending on where you live). If it continues getting larger, more painful, forms pus, or if new spots keep appearing, you should see a healthcare provider, as you might need a prescription antibiotic to fully clear it.

The marks on my jaw (you can sort of see it in all of them, but ""three"" focuses on it Ã¢Â€Â“ albeit, a bit washed out from the light) are similar to the one on my cheek. Some dead skin/sort-of-a-scab flaked off today leaving some fresh-pink skin.

The facial hair is sort of a new thing, so I thought they might be caused by some irritation/ingrown hairs, but that doesn't seem quite right from my previous experiences. I also have about two marks (similar to the stuff on my jaw I suppose) that might be related or simply caused by the irritation of my beard. 

Any help would be seriously appreciated.","I'm an AI developed by OpenAI and I'm not a dermatologist, but based on your description, it could be a number of things. It could be a simple skin irritation or inflammation from scratching, an ingrown hair, or possibly a minor skin infection. It's also possible that it's a type of acne, particularly if you've recently started growing facial hair and your skin isn't accustomed to it. 

The best course of action is to keep the area clean and avoid scratching it. Over-the-counter treatments like hydrocortisone cream might help with inflammation and itching. If it gets worse or doesn't improve in a week or so, you should definitely consult a healthcare professional or a dermatologist. They can give you a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.

I know these are shit, but I am guessing not that important.","Wash and wait.
Time is the only factor here.","It sounds like you're doing all the right things so far by getting stitches for the inside of your lip. After an injury like this, swelling and firmness are completely normal in the first few days. To help your lip heal properly and reduce swelling, continue using **cold compresses** (wrapped in a cloth, not directly on the skin) for 10Â–15 minutes a few times a day for the first 48 hours. After that, you can switch to **warm compresses** to improve blood flow and speed up healing.

Keep the area **clean** by gently rinsing with a saltwater solution (especially after eating) to prevent infection. Avoid stretching your mouth too much while it heals Â— so try to eat soft foods and avoid heavy chewing. **Stay hydrated** and avoid anything that could irritate the area, like spicy foods, alcohol, or smoking.

Minor bumps or firmness after healing can sometimes persist for a few weeks, but most swelling goes down significantly after about 7Â–10 days. Scarring inside the lip is rare and usually minimal because the mouth heals very well. This isnÂ’t medical advice, and if you notice increasing pain, redness, pus, or worsening swelling after a few days, itÂ’s important to see your doctor.

Would you like a simple daily care checklist you can follow for faster recovery?","Busted my lip and need advice on how to heal it properly!

I know these are shit, but I am guessing not that important.","I'm sorry to hear about your accident! Here are some steps you can take to help your lip heal quicker:

1. **Ice:** Apply an ice pack for 15 minutes every hour for the first 24 hours. This will significantly reduce swelling. 

2. **Hydrate:** Drink plenty of fluids to keep your body hydrated. This will help in the healing process.

3. **Eat Healthy:** A diet rich in vitamin C and zinc promotes wound healing. 

4. **Avoid Irritants:** Do not consume hot or spicy foods, or alcohol, as these can irritate the wound. 

5. **Keep it Clean:** Keep the area clean by rinsing with warm salt water. Avoid touching the wound with your fingers.

6. **Avoid Straining:** Try not to stretch your mouth too much during the healing process as it can cause the wound to open again. 

7. **Visit Your Doctor:** If you notice any signs of infection such as increased pain, redness, fever or pus, it's important to see your doctor immediately.

8. **Use Over-The-Counter Medication:** Use over-the-counter pain relievers or anti-inflammatory medicine to help with discomfort and swelling. 

9. **Lip Balm:** Once the wound starts to heal, keep the area moisturized with a lip balm to prevent it from cracking and drying out which could delay the healing process.

10. **Follow Up:** Make sure to follow up with your doctor to have your stitches removed (if they're not dissolvable) and to ensure that your lip is healing properly.

It is near the arch of my left foot, on the inside of the arch kind of. I will notice it maybe 5 - 10 times per day.

EDIT:* I have anxiety issues and sometimes I wonder if it is related to my anxiety.","Any pain? Any numbness?

It could be plantar fasciitis. It could be B12 deficiency. It could be your anxiety...","The sensation you're describing Â— a brief, internal ""hot"" feeling in part of your foot Â— is actually fairly common and often not serious, especially if itÂ’s brief, not worsening, and thereÂ’s no external redness or swelling. Possible causes include **minor nerve irritation** or **entrapment**, sometimes from posture, footwear, or even mild mechanical pressure on a nerve near the arch. Anxiety can also heighten your awareness of bodily sensations and amplify how they feel, making harmless nerve misfires seem much more alarming.

Other possibilities include mild **plantar fasciitis** (early irritation of the foot arch tissue), or minor **circulation changes**, neither of which are typically dangerous if they stay mild and isolated. ItÂ’s also a good sign that youÂ’re not experiencing numbness, weakness, or constant pain, which would be more concerning.

This isnÂ’t medical advice, and you should definitely mention it to your doctor if it continues, worsens, or if other symptoms develop.

Since you mentioned that you have anxiety issues, it's possible that this sensation could be linked to that. Anxiety can sometimes cause physical symptoms like this due to the body's stress response. However, it's important to get this checked by your healthcare provider to rule out any potential underlying conditions. Any persistent or unusual symptom should be evaluated by a doctor.

30,Weird thing with my eyes,"My eyes never change, like if I've been smoking weed, no matter how much, my eyes never change, and pupils never dialate/constrict on painkillers or psychedelics, why? I still feel every other effect of the drugs, also I'm colorblind if that might make a difference.",What happens if you stand in a dark room and point a flashlight to your face? Your pupils constrict? ,"What you're describing Â— having minimal pupil response to substances that usually affect pupil size Â— is unusual but not necessarily alarming by itself. Normally, drugs like cannabis, painkillers, and psychedelics affect the **autonomic nervous system**, which controls involuntary actions like pupil dilation and constriction. Some people naturally have a **lower sensitivity** in these pathways, meaning their pupils don't react strongly even when their brain is affected.

Being **colorblind** suggests some differences in how your eyes and visual system developed, but colorblindness itself usually affects the retina (how you perceive color), not the muscles that control pupil size. However, it's possible there could be subtle differences in your **autonomic nervous control** or **neuromuscular response** that arenÂ’t causing any real health problems but slightly alter how your body reacts to certain substances.

Another possibility is simply **genetic variation**: some people's bodies metabolize or react to drugs differently without anything being wrong. As long as youÂ’re otherwise healthy, your vision is stable, and your pupils react normally to changes in light (like a dark room vs. bright light), itÂ’s probably just a unique variation for you.

This isnÂ’t medical advice, and if you ever notice **new problems** with your vision, light sensitivity, or other eye issues, you should see an ophthalmologist. Would you like me to suggest a few easy tests you can do at home to check how your pupils react in different lighting?","Weird thing with my eyes

My eyes never change, like if I've been smoking weed, no matter how much, my eyes never change, and pupils never dialate/constrict on painkillers or psychedelics, why? I still feel every other effect of the drugs, also I'm colorblind if that might make a difference.","The dilation or constriction of pupils is largely controlled by the autonomic nervous system. Many substances, including marijuana, opiates, and psychedelics, can cause changes in the size of the pupils, but this isn't always the case for everyone. Not everyone's body reacts exactly the same way to substances. Genetic differences, metabolism, tolerance, or even the interaction with other substances or medications you might be taking can influence how your body reacts.

Being colorblind shouldn't affect the dilation or constriction of your pupils in response to substances, as colorblindness is related to the function of the cones in your retina, not the muscles that control the size of your pupils. 

It's also important to note that not all drugs will cause noticeable changes in pupil size. For example, marijuana is more likely to cause redness in the eyes due to increased blood flow rather than a significant change in pupil size.

However, if you're regularly using substances and not experiencing typical side effects, it's worth discussing this with your healthcare provider to make sure there's not an underlying health issue that's affecting your body's responses.",3.0,1.0,4.28,4.54
31,"Why is my poo so dark, sticky and smelly? I currently on a strict paleo diet","It's weird. Before I went on a diet free of processed, frozen, junk, sugary foods, my poop was okay. You heard of people saying orange-brown is best poo colour? They're right and thats what I've had. BEFORE I changed to a new diet. Heres my current of what I eat on a typical day:

**BREAKFAST**

- Raw Vegetable greens

I exercise by running and lifting weights on alternate days. And yet my poop is still sticky, dark green/brown in colour and very smelly.

","I actually have lactose intolerance myself, so I don't eat diary. But if you don't have lactose intolerance diary is fine. If you do, avoid it. Simple as that. I never said someone with lactose intolerance should eat diary.

I do believe people can be allergic to dust and mold, but I don't see how that is relevant to this conversation. OP is having symptoms because of his Paleo diet, and everyone is recommending he continues with it, which makes no sense to me. ","Your concerns make a lot of sense Â— itÂ’s frustrating when you switch to a super clean diet and notice something unexpected like changes in your stool. Based on what you described, a few things are likely happening that explain the dark, sticky, and smellier poop:

First, the **high amount of leafy greens** (like kale, spinach, and broccoli) naturally leads to **darker, sometimes green-tinted stools**. Chlorophyll (the pigment in green plants) and higher bile output from digesting so many fibrous vegetables can darken the color of your stool significantly. Second, **high-fat foods** like almond flour pastries and a lot of nuts can cause stool to become **stickier** and **more pungent**, because fat is harder to digest, especially in large amounts. The smelliness is also normal Â— certain fibers and sulfur-rich vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower release gases during digestion, which make stools smell stronger.

What youÂ’re seeing is actually pretty normal for someone on a strict, fiber-heavy, plant-rich paleo diet. As long as youÂ’re not experiencing alarming symptoms like persistent diarrhea, bleeding, or severe abdominal pain, it's most likely just your body adjusting to the new nutrient and fiber load.

This isn't medical advice Â— if symptoms ever worsen, or if the stool turns black like tar (which could suggest bleeding higher in the gut), you should definitely consult a healthcare provider. Would you like me to suggest a few gentle diet tweaks to help your digestion adjust more comfortably?","Why is my poo so dark, sticky and smelly? I currently on a strict paleo diet

","Dietary changes can significantly affect the color, consistency, and smell of your stool. Your current diet is rich in fiber, which can cause darker and stickier stool. The high intake of vegetables like broccoli, kale and spinach which are high in chlorophyll can also cause your stool to be greenish. 

The smell could be due to the high intake of certain sulfur-rich vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and kale. These vegetables contain compounds that can produce a strong odor when broken down in the gut.

Another possible reason might be that your body is still adjusting to your new diet. Sudden dietary changes can cause temporary digestive upset as your gut flora adjusts. 

However, if you're experiencing other symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, or changes in frequency of bowel movements, or if this continues for a prolonged period, it would be a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider.

32,Stomach pains after taking cold medicine?,"I've been sick for over a week, taking day/nyquil 4 times a day every day. 2 days ago, i started taking muciniex(sp?) and it finally cleared up.

Would need a lot more info on what kind of sick you were for a week, where your pain is located, how it changes with position, becomes worse if you press your abdomen, if you have nausea, how exactly the ""waves of pain"" are and so on. 

I'd say that in general, most abdominal pain is benign, nothing is wrong and you don't need to see a doctor. However if the pain is severe, doesn't go away in a couple of hours or more or is located in specific places like your upper right side you might need to see a doctor. 

It's pretty unlikely that the medicines you took have caused something wrong, but I know one of the side effects of Mucinex is kidney stones, which is one of many possible explainations for your pain. 

I guess you have to use your own instincts here. If your pain is severe and not going away on its own it might be time to see a doctor.","It makes complete sense that youÂ’re worried, especially because the pain is bad enough to wake you up and hasnÂ’t gone away after eating or vomiting. Taking a lot of over-the-counter cold medications Â— like DayQuil, NyQuil, and Mucinex Â— over several days can definitely irritate your stomach. Many cold medicines contain ingredients like **acetaminophen**, **ibuprofen**, **decongestants**, or **alcohol-based syrups**, which can be very hard on the stomach lining. This can lead to **gastritis** (inflammation of the stomach) or even, in worse cases, cause small ulcers or bleeding.

The fact that your pain comes in waves and doesnÂ’t feel like typical nausea or diarrhea fits with stomach lining irritation. Even though you're only 17, itÂ’s important not to ignore severe or persistent stomach pain, especially if itÂ’s worsening or keeping you from sleeping.

This isnÂ’t medical advice, but based on what youÂ’ve described, it would be smart to **tell a parent or trusted adult** and **see a doctor** Â— even if youÂ’re unsure about insurance. Many clinics have options for minors, and itÂ’s better to be safe, especially because untreated stomach issues can get worse.

In the meantime, **stop all cold medicines**, stick to very gentle foods (like plain rice, bananas, applesauce), stay hydrated, and avoid anything acidic, spicy, or heavy. If you develop new symptoms like vomiting blood, black stools, severe weakness, or a fever, you need immediate care.

Would you like me to also suggest a simple way you could explain this to your parents so it doesnÂ’t sound like youÂ’re panicking, just being responsible?","Stomach pains after taking cold medicine?

33,"Stomach upset, anxiety, sleep cycle screwy: What's wrong with me?!","Warning, long post. There's a tl;dr at the end, but you'd be missing a lot of background! :P  Also, I know the whole ""Reddit is not a substitute for professional medical advice"", I'm just trying to see if anyone has experienced anything similar / has any advice.  I'm not the kind of person who really ever goes to the doctor, and if a lifestyle change could help me I'd much rather do that first than spend thousands of dollars to have a doctor tell me the same thing.  However, this has been going on for over a year now and is impacting my life, and I want to do something about it if possible.

Quick about me: Male, 26, 6ft 145lb.

Current complaint:

Basically the biggest issue is that my stomach seems rather overly sensitive.  Every morning it feels uncomfortable / bloated, whether I force myself to eat something or not.  This often persists through the afternoon, and on occasion the entire day.  The discomfort is not so much pain as it is pressure, mild nausea, and bloating / the need to burp.  Sometimes antacids help a little, although that may just be placebo, and forcing myself to burp can help too. BM's range from 3 to 6 on the Bristol scale, varying on a near daily basis, and with the sense that things are not spending more than 12-24 hours in the GI system.  

This issue causes my second complaint, or is perhaps caused by, or perhaps they feed each other, which is kind of anxiety.  That is, when my stomach is upset, it makes me worry about it, which probably makes it more upset.  I'll start worrying that this time my stomach is going to be a little more upset than normal and I'll vomit, or that people will notice my discomfort, or... well, it's hard to describe because I know it's not really a logical feeling, but suffice to say my upset stomach can make me feel quite anxious especially when I'm around other people.

A third thing that may factor in to this situation is my sleep cycle.  I am currently trying to get a good amount of sleep, usually going to bed between 11 and 12, and waking up usually around 9am. Despite this, when I wake up I still feel incredibly tired (though not always sleepy, sometimes I wake up naturally but still feel groggy and tired).  I really can't get going sometimes until 10am, and I'm usually still a bit out of it (and worrying about my upset stomach) for the rest of the morning.


Background:

As for the stomach issue, I don't know where this is coming from. Growing up I was never particularly food sensitive (though I did tend to be a picky eater).  I believe I am mildly lactose intolerant, although I never ate very many milk products anyway -- don't like cheese or yogurt or drinking milk, that pretty much leaves ice cream, and these days I take lactaid with ice cream.  Last year I discovered that I'm apparently allergic to bananas; I had started eating bananas in 2012 and would have them as snacks, but at the same time my digestive health was going downhill, painful upset stomachs and occasionally bloody stool. Took me some time to make the connection, but I eventually realized that my stomach always became upset 15-20 minutes after eating a banana.  Stopped eating them and improved immediately.  However, I guess I'd say I never went quite back to normal, because since them I've been experiencing the symptoms described above.

I'd also classify myself as eating generally decently, I eat out some and cook for myself some, eat a mix of fruits, vegetables, meats, and pastathings, drink probably 80oz of water a day and a little fruit juice, not too into sweet foods / drinks, rarely ever drink alcohol or anything with caffeine. I'm underweight if anything.

For the anxiety, well, I'm not entirely surprised at myself. I've always been extraordinarily shy / had social anxiety issues.  Any time I'm entering a new situation or one where I'm not in control, I'm likely to feel some anxiety.  In my younger years I believe I suffered from depression; though it was never diagnosed or treated, I was really pessimistic about life and occasionally mildly suicidal. In the past 5-6 years, my mental state has dramatically improved with respect to the depression, and I've gained some confidence, but I'm still likely to be very anxious and/or awkward in social situations.  I suppose in my current situation, it's the fact that I can't control my stomach upset, and it might be noticed by others, and it might be potentially embarrassing, that causes my anxiety. Alternately, I'm experiencing stress / generalized anxiety which manifests as an overly sensitive stomach -- this is something I am not really certain about, is the anxiety an amplifying factor in a physical stomach condition, or is an upset stomach a psychosomatic response to a mental condition?

As for my sleep cycle, I've always been a ""night owl"" and have always functioned better at night. That said, in high school and before I had to get up early, and was able to do so without these issues. Throughout college, I also kept a generally earlier schedule.  It's only been the past couple years that I've just been unable to function well in the morning (oh, and if I force myself to get up earlier, my stomach will be even more upset throughout the day).  It doesn't matter if I go to bed at 9pm or at midnight, I still can't function in the morning (and I'll sometimes still take a nap for an hour or two in the late afternoon).  I'd almost describe myself as delayed-phase sleep disorder, because sometimes when I decide to stay up late working, I'll feel best and get the most done from like 11pm to 3-4am.  



So, Reddit, what do you think?  Do I have some physical issue causing my digestive upset, and if so is it some chronic lifelong thing, or something that could be treated / mitigated?  Or do I have some mental issue that's manifesting itself as sleep cycle problems and upset stomach?  Or do I have a sleep disorder that's causing stomach and mood disturbances? or do I have a bad case of intestinal gnomes?

tl;dr:  Suffering from chronic upset stomach (lack of appetite, nausea, bloating and discomfort); anxiety; and delayed sleep cycle / inability to function in the morning.  All three seem to be related, but I'm not sure what the core issue is nor what to do about it.  However, this has been going on for a while and is negatively impacting my quality of life, so I want to figure something out.","What you are describing here is basically a textbook case of mild irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and a mild social anxiety disorder combined. IBS is a functional bowel disorder strongly associated with anxiety and other psychosocial factors. Patients with IBS also have increased motility of their GI-tract (which you are describing) and often increased sensitivity to distention of their GI-tract. About 20% of the general population fulfill criteria for IBS, so it's very common. 

So the question is, what can be done to help you? Sometimes it can be helpful to eliminate/reduce certain things from your diet. About 20% will have some relief of symptoms by eliminating lactose (which you already did) and wheat from their diets. Also reducing caffeine (which can also increase anxiety, but you rarely use it it seems) and artificial sweeteners can help. 

As for the anxiety, there are many options. Being shy and feeling social anxiety in new situations is extremely common - so common that we may call it normal. You can always take some measures yourself to help your anxiety - like exposing yourself to new situations more often and going out to meet people more often. I know this can be very difficult, because it's unpleasant, but it will help in the long run. For example, when you have a choice between going out and staying home, try to always chose the option of going out. Just know that social anxiety is very normal, and everyone feels some anxiety in new situations where they dont have control. As long as you're able to live with it and go on with your daily activites it doesn't necessarily have to be a big problem. 

However if your anxiety comes to the point where you are isolating yourself or unable to go on with your normal life, I'd recommend seeing a psychologist. The best treatment right now is cognitive behavioral therapy, which is generally very effective. There are also drug treatments with SSRI's (anti-depressants) and specifically for anxiety and IBS, amitripyline. 

I think your sleep cycle-issues are also related to your anxiety, but might also be symptoms of depression. 

If you have any questions or something is unclear, feel free to ask and I'll try my best to answer.","Thank you for your detailed and thoughtful explanation—your openness gives a strong foundation for exploring possible explanations and next steps. Based on the constellation of symptoms you're describing—chronic digestive discomfort (especially in the morning), variable bowel movements, persistent bloating and nausea, anxiety that's often tied to gastrointestinal distress, and a delayed sleep-wake cycle—it’s likely that these issues are interconnected, and the root may lie in a combination of functional gastrointestinal disorder (like IBS), anxiety-spectrum symptoms, and circadian rhythm disruption.

From the GI perspective, your symptoms—bloating, morning discomfort, fluctuating stools, mild nausea, and a sense of urgency or pressure—are consistent with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), which is a common, chronic condition that can be exacerbated by stress, anxiety, and diet. The banana allergy you mentioned may have initiated a heightened sensitivity in your gut, which never fully resolved and left you with a more reactive digestive system. Additionally, anxiety can significantly amplify gut symptoms due to the gut-brain axis—a two-way communication system between your central nervous system and your digestive tract. This means that your stomach issues could both be causing and resulting from anxiety, creating a feedback loop.

Your sleep difficulties—despite allocating adequate time for rest—do resemble features of Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD). This condition is characterized by a natural tendency to fall asleep and wake later than socially typical, and can lead to grogginess, trouble functioning in the morning, and even exacerbate mood or digestive symptoms due to circadian misalignment. When the body’s internal clock is out of sync with meal timing and light exposure, digestion can become sluggish or hypersensitive, further complicating your symptoms.

Given your history of social anxiety and possibly undiagnosed depression, it’s also important to acknowledge that Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or residual symptoms from past depressive episodes could be playing a role. Anxiety doesn’t just manifest mentally—it often presents physically, and the gut is particularly sensitive to this. The persistent worry about being embarrassed or sick in public, and the resulting stress, might be intensifying your GI sensitivity.

In terms of actionable steps, you might benefit from a multifaceted approach:

Dietary review with a registered dietitian, possibly exploring a low FODMAP diet, which is commonly helpful for IBS-like symptoms.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or a form of gut-directed hypnotherapy, which has shown promising results for people with overlapping anxiety and digestive issues.

Sleep hygiene improvements and potentially chronotherapy (gradually shifting your sleep time) to realign your circadian rhythm. If this proves challenging, consulting a sleep specialist may help confirm or manage a delayed sleep phase disorder.

Medical evaluation to rule out conditions like H. pylori infection, SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth), or celiac disease, especially since symptoms persist long-term. Even a basic stool test or non-invasive breath test could provide helpful information.

Ultimately, while it's very reasonable to try lifestyle-based changes first, given that your symptoms are chronic and impacting quality of life, it may be worth investing in an initial consultation with a GI specialist or a functional medicine provider. You don’t need to commit to extensive testing right away, but a focused conversation with a professional might give you targeted suggestions beyond what self-management alone can achieve.

Would you like help building a step-by-step plan you could try on your own before pursuing clinical care?","Stomach upset, anxiety, sleep cycle screwy: What's wrong with me?!

Warning, long post. There's a tl;dr at the end, but you'd be missing a lot of background! :P  Also, I know the whole ""Reddit is not a substitute for professional medical advice"", I'm just trying to see if anyone has experienced anything similar / has any advice.  I'm not the kind of person who really ever goes to the doctor, and if a lifestyle change could help me I'd much rather do that first than spend thousands of dollars to have a doctor tell me the same thing.  However, this has been going on for over a year now and is impacting my life, and I want to do something about it if possible.

Quick about me: Male, 26, 6ft 145lb.

Current complaint:

Basically the biggest issue is that my stomach seems rather overly sensitive.  Every morning it feels uncomfortable / bloated, whether I force myself to eat something or not.  This often persists through the afternoon, and on occasion the entire day.  The discomfort is not so much pain as it is pressure, mild nausea, and bloating / the need to burp.  Sometimes antacids help a little, although that may just be placebo, and forcing myself to burp can help too. BM's range from 3 to 6 on the Bristol scale, varying on a near daily basis, and with the sense that things are not spending more than 12-24 hours in the GI system.  

This issue causes my second complaint, or is perhaps caused by, or perhaps they feed each other, which is kind of anxiety.  That is, when my stomach is upset, it makes me worry about it, which probably makes it more upset.  I'll start worrying that this time my stomach is going to be a little more upset than normal and I'll vomit, or that people will notice my discomfort, or... well, it's hard to describe because I know it's not really a logical feeling, but suffice to say my upset stomach can make me feel quite anxious especially when I'm around other people.

A third thing that may factor in to this situation is my sleep cycle.  I am currently trying to get a good amount of sleep, usually going to bed between 11 and 12, and waking up usually around 9am. Despite this, when I wake up I still feel incredibly tired (though not always sleepy, sometimes I wake up naturally but still feel groggy and tired).  I really can't get going sometimes until 10am, and I'm usually still a bit out of it (and worrying about my upset stomach) for the rest of the morning.


Background:

As for the stomach issue, I don't know where this is coming from. Growing up I was never particularly food sensitive (though I did tend to be a picky eater).  I believe I am mildly lactose intolerant, although I never ate very many milk products anyway -- don't like cheese or yogurt or drinking milk, that pretty much leaves ice cream, and these days I take lactaid with ice cream.  Last year I discovered that I'm apparently allergic to bananas; I had started eating bananas in 2012 and would have them as snacks, but at the same time my digestive health was going downhill, painful upset stomachs and occasionally bloody stool. Took me some time to make the connection, but I eventually realized that my stomach always became upset 15-20 minutes after eating a banana.  Stopped eating them and improved immediately.  However, I guess I'd say I never went quite back to normal, because since them I've been experiencing the symptoms described above.

I'd also classify myself as eating generally decently, I eat out some and cook for myself some, eat a mix of fruits, vegetables, meats, and pastathings, drink probably 80oz of water a day and a little fruit juice, not too into sweet foods / drinks, rarely ever drink alcohol or anything with caffeine. I'm underweight if anything.

For the anxiety, well, I'm not entirely surprised at myself. I've always been extraordinarily shy / had social anxiety issues.  Any time I'm entering a new situation or one where I'm not in control, I'm likely to feel some anxiety.  In my younger years I believe I suffered from depression; though it was never diagnosed or treated, I was really pessimistic about life and occasionally mildly suicidal. In the past 5-6 years, my mental state has dramatically improved with respect to the depression, and I've gained some confidence, but I'm still likely to be very anxious and/or awkward in social situations.  I suppose in my current situation, it's the fact that I can't control my stomach upset, and it might be noticed by others, and it might be potentially embarrassing, that causes my anxiety. Alternately, I'm experiencing stress / generalized anxiety which manifests as an overly sensitive stomach -- this is something I am not really certain about, is the anxiety an amplifying factor in a physical stomach condition, or is an upset stomach a psychosomatic response to a mental condition?

As for my sleep cycle, I've always been a ""night owl"" and have always functioned better at night. That said, in high school and before I had to get up early, and was able to do so without these issues. Throughout college, I also kept a generally earlier schedule.  It's only been the past couple years that I've just been unable to function well in the morning (oh, and if I force myself to get up earlier, my stomach will be even more upset throughout the day).  It doesn't matter if I go to bed at 9pm or at midnight, I still can't function in the morning (and I'll sometimes still take a nap for an hour or two in the late afternoon).  I'd almost describe myself as delayed-phase sleep disorder, because sometimes when I decide to stay up late working, I'll feel best and get the most done from like 11pm to 3-4am.  



So, Reddit, what do you think?  Do I have some physical issue causing my digestive upset, and if so is it some chronic lifelong thing, or something that could be treated / mitigated?  Or do I have some mental issue that's manifesting itself as sleep cycle problems and upset stomach?  Or do I have a sleep disorder that's causing stomach and mood disturbances? or do I have a bad case of intestinal gnomes?

tl;dr:  Suffering from chronic upset stomach (lack of appetite, nausea, bloating and discomfort); anxiety; and delayed sleep cycle / inability to function in the morning.  All three seem to be related, but I'm not sure what the core issue is nor what to do about it.  However, this has been going on for a while and is negatively impacting my quality of life, so I want to figure something out.","Your symptoms could be indicative of several conditions such as IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), anxiety disorders, or even certain food intolerances. However, it's important to note that the symptoms you're experiencing can be interrelated or they could be separate issues altogether. 

IBS is a common condition that affects the digestive system. It can cause stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. Symptoms can vary in severity and duration from person to person. It's not exactly clear what causes IBS, but certain things like food passing through your gut too quickly or too slowly, oversensitive nerves in your gut, stress, and a family history of IBS can contribute to its development. 

Anxiety disorders can also cause some of the symptoms you're describing. People with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive, and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. This can lead to physical symptoms like an upset stomach, fatigue, and insomnia. 

Finally, food intolerances or allergies can cause digestive problems. It's possible that you could have an intolerance to a certain type of food that's causing your upset stomach. 

It's important to seek professional medical advice to get a correct diagnosis and treatment plan. You should consider scheduling an appointment with a gastroenterologist to discuss your digestive issues and also consider seeking help from a mental health professional for your anxiety and sleep issues.

In the meantime, you can try to identify any patterns or triggers for your symptoms. Keeping a food and symptom diary can help you identify any foods or situations that seem to make your symptoms worse. It may also be beneficial to try relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises or meditation to help manage your anxiety. 

Remember, only a healthcare professional can diagnose your symptoms accurately. Do not hesitate to seek help if your symptoms persist or worsen.",9.5,8.5,5.78,7.03
34,Can a Doctor Fix My Anal Region???,"I was experimenting with masturbation and I tried to stimulate the prostate glad. I got really rough and literally rubbed skin off right around the anus. There was alittle skin that actually came of and it left a little scratch indent that expands and contracts under the anus. At some angles you can not see it but at others it looks like another hole under the anus. It hasn't gone away in a year so I think it is permanently scared like that. It doesnt hurt but I don't want a torn looking anus. Is there anyway they can fix this problem? Where would I go? Could a regular doctor do it???

Male","If you plan on having a lot of people looking at your anus throughout your adult life and you want it to look like the beautiful star it deserves to be, I guess you should talk to a private surgical clinic. A regular doctor wouldn't touch that (not because it's your anus of course, because he wouldn't know what to do with it).","Thank you for your question—this is more common than you might think, and it's good you're asking about it now. Based on your description, it sounds like what you're seeing is likely a healed scar or skin indentation from the abrasion caused during rough anal stimulation. If it's been a year with no pain, bleeding, or signs of infection, it probably isn’t a medical emergency. However, the lingering change in appearance—what you described as looking like a second hole or a stretched area—might be a cosmetic scar or a slight change in skin texture, which can happen after trauma in sensitive areas.

Yes, a doctor can help—start with a primary care physician, as they can examine the area and determine whether what you're seeing is scar tissue, a fissure that didn't heal smoothly, or (less likely) a sinus or skin tag that formed post-injury. If needed, they can refer you to a colorectal surgeon or a dermatologist for further evaluation, especially if cosmetic correction is something you’re considering.

In cases where there's no pain but there's lasting concern about appearance or skin texture, minor surgical options such as scar revision, skin tag removal, or minor excision and suturing might be discussed. These are typically outpatient procedures and are done for comfort or cosmetic reasons, especially if the area causes distress.

Rest assured: this is something that doctors, particularly in proctology or dermatology, deal with regularly. You don't need to feel embarrassed—just be honest during the exam.

Would you like guidance on what to say or how to prepare for an appointment like this?","Can a Doctor Fix My Anal Region???

35,Just how dangerous is it to drink a lot of energy drinks?,"For the past 6 years I have been drinking 1 liters of Euro Shopper energy drink every single day. I am addicted but I don't want to stop because it's cheap and I like it. I am not overweight at all, and I exercise regularly. Is it still dangerous?","If the source from wikipedia is correct, 1 liter of Euro Shopper contain about 320mg of caffeine, which is equivalent to 3-5 cups of coffee. I can't imagine that this will be dangerous. Some times energy drinks contain other stimulants, such as ginseng and guarana, which may potentiate the effect of coffeine or in the case of guarana, contain coffeine themself. Therefore it can be difficult to know exactly how much caffeine and how potent an energy drink is, but I still don't think it's particularly dangerous. A bigger concern is the amount of sugar in it, but I guess you are aware of that.

Possible side effects are insomnia, anxiety, irritability, diarrhea, increased blood pressure, heart palptations and very rarely heart arrhythmias.","Even if you’re physically active and not overweight, drinking 1 liter of energy drink every day for 6 years carries significant long-term health risks, especially due to the high caffeine, sugar, and additive content common in these types of beverages.

Here's what you should be concerned about:

Cardiovascular risks: High daily caffeine intake can lead to elevated heart rate, high blood pressure, and over time, increase your risk for arrhythmias or even heart disease. Energy drinks often exceed safe daily caffeine limits, especially in large quantities.

Sugar load: Depending on the formula, 1 liter of energy drink can contain upwards of 100 grams of sugar, which is far beyond recommended daily limits. Even if you're not gaining weight, this can strain your pancreas, increase your insulin resistance, and raise your risk for type 2 diabetes or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Kidney function: Long-term overuse of highly caffeinated and sugary beverages can contribute to kidney strain or damage, especially if hydration is coming mostly from these drinks instead of water.

Mental health effects: Chronic caffeine overuse can heighten anxiety, sleep disturbances, and potentially worsen mood regulation, even if you feel functional in your daily life.

Tolerance and withdrawal: Regular high caffeine intake builds physical dependence. If you ever stop abruptly, you may face withdrawal symptoms like fatigue, irritability, and headaches.

Even though you feel okay now, these risks build silently over time. The fact that you've been consuming this amount daily for years means it’s worth seriously considering a gradual reduction, rather than cold turkey, to ease any withdrawal effects. You don’t need to stop enjoying energy drinks entirely, but shifting to a lower-caffeine or sugar-free version or alternating with water can be a practical step toward reducing the burden on your heart, liver, and kidneys.

Would you be open to a slow-cutback strategy that doesn’t force you to quit all at once?","Just how dangerous is it to drink a lot of energy drinks?

I am not overweight at all, and I exercise regularly. Is it still dangerous?","Drinking energy drinks on a daily basis, especially in large quantities, can have several negative health effects. Here are a few:

1. Caffeine Overdose: Energy drinks contain high amounts of caffeine. Consuming them excessively can lead to caffeine overdose, which can cause palpitations, high blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, convulsions and, in some cases, even death.

2. Sugar Overload: Most energy drinks contain high amounts of sugar. Consuming too much sugar can increase your risk of developing diabetes, obesity, and other health problems.

3. Dehydration: Caffeine is a diuretic, which means it helps to remove fluids from the body. This can lead to dehydration, especially if you consume energy drinks in large amounts or while doing physical activity.

4. Dental Problems: The high sugar content can also lead to tooth decay and other dental problems.

5. Negative Impact on Mental Health: Some studies suggest that the high amounts of caffeine can lead to mental health problems like anxiety and depression, especially when consumed in large amounts over a long period.

6. Kidney Damage: The high levels of caffeine and sugar can put a lot of stress on your kidneys and can lead to long-term kidney damage.

Even if you're not overweight and exercise regularly, consuming 1 liter of energy drink daily can have serious health consequences in the long run. It's important to try and cut back on your consumption, or better yet, try to quit altogether. If you're finding it hard, consider seeking professional help.",8.5,8.5,6.53,6.47

So what we are interested in is; are you caucasian, african american, asian, etc.

The reason this can be important is that prevalence of certain diseases are different among different races. An extreme example is Tay-Sachs Disease. Tay-Sachs Disease is very rare, except in Azkenazi-Jews where the carrier rate of the affected gene is about 1/25. Sometimes treatment can be different for different races too. For example, there is some evidence to say that african americans benefit more from diuretics or calcium channel blockers for hypertension, rather than other drugs.","In most contexts, when people refer to “race” in discussions—especially in places like Reddit—it typically means broad social groupings based on shared physical characteristics (like skin color), ancestry, or geographic origins. It's not a biological classification with sharp boundaries, but rather a social construct that has real-world effects, particularly in areas like identity, history, healthcare disparities, and systemic inequality.

As for the ""[Meta]"" tag—if this was part of a Reddit post—it usually means the question is about the subreddit itself. So if someone asked ""Race?"" with a ""[Meta]"" tag, they might be questioning whether the subreddit has specific rules, assumptions, or limitations related to race (e.g. ""Is this subreddit only for people of a certain background?"" or ""Is race a relevant topic here?"").

37,Is this reflux or something else?,"Sorry for my bad english, I'm not a native speaker.

When under mental (job interview, school exam) or physical stress (running, demanding workout) I start to retch and have to stop what I am doing and kneel down, shut my eyes and stay immobile to control my breath for 5-15 seconds while it passes away. I never wommit, but feel like I will any second.

It all started when I was in elementary school and realized that sit-ups make me nauseaus. I had no other sympthoms back than right until first year of university where the stress levels were much higher. There 10-30 minutes before exams I started the retching part.

At the age of 30 I gained a lot of weight, I was about 104kg and 185cm tall. I did martial arts, but the above described sympthoms appeart. It was so bad that just sitting in my car seemed to compress my stomach and lungs and I started retching.

At 32 I lost almost 20kgs and all sympthoms wanished. Now I'm back at about 95 and the sympthoms are worse than ever, especially because I had a knee injury last autumn and my conditioning is pretty bad right now.

The problem now is that I also seem to have decreased lung capacity. When I'm out of breath, the retching starts immedietly. I never smoked or drinked alcohol ever and still try my best during trainings, but my condition doesn't improve much.

During wrestling when my upper body is compressed, I immedietly start to panic beacause I'm out of breath. Never had this problem before.

Eating a lot and sugary drinks (especially energy drinks) make the sympthoms appear for sure, don't even have to stress or move a lot.

This could be just reflux or hiatus hernia, but I don't get the usual reflux sympthoms (no heartburn, no pain, no acid taste... maybe the cough part, but I'm not sure).

Is this reflux or something else?",Sounds like it's more probable that this is related to anxiety rather than an organic disease like reflux. Your symptoms are very much like mild panic attacks. ,"Thank you for sharing such a detailed and thoughtful explanation—your English is clear, and you've described your symptoms very well. Based on everything you’ve described—retching triggered by stress (both physical and mental), worsened by compression of the upper body, eating large meals or sugary drinks, and accompanied by shortness of breath—it’s possible that what you’re experiencing could be related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or a hiatal hernia, but it also sounds like there may be other contributing factors at play, including respiratory and possibly anxiety-related components.

First, while you don’t report classic reflux symptoms like heartburn or a sour taste, GERD can still be present in atypical forms. These can include:

Chronic throat clearing or cough

Retching or gagging, especially after eating or with abdominal pressure

A sensation of “air hunger” or chest tightness (especially when stomach contents press upward)

A hiatal hernia could also cause or worsen these symptoms—especially when bending, doing sit-ups, or under pressure—because part of the stomach can push through the diaphragm and interfere with both digestion and breathing. This could explain why sitting in the car, doing sit-ups, or grappling in wrestling triggers the sensation of breathlessness and retching.

However, you also mention shortness of breath, worsened physical conditioning, and panic or anxiety sensations, particularly when your upper body is compressed or you’re out of breath. These symptoms could point to a combination of physical and psychological triggers, such as:

Exercise-induced or stress-induced hyperventilation or even mild panic attacks

Deconditioning of your respiratory muscles after weight gain and injury

Possibly diaphragmatic dysfunction, especially if there's been long-term pressure from excess abdominal fat or a past undiagnosed issue

The fact that your symptoms dramatically improved with weight loss and worsened again with weight gain strongly supports the idea that mechanical pressure from abdominal fat may be affecting your diaphragm, stomach, and possibly lower esophageal sphincter function. Sugary drinks and overeating can increase gastric pressure and trigger retching, even without causing the burning sensation typical of acid reflux.

In summary, this may be a multifactorial issue, including:

Atypical GERD or hiatal hernia

Decreased cardiopulmonary fitness

A stress response or mild panic component during exertion

Mechanical restriction due to body composition

It would be best to consult a gastroenterologist to evaluate for GERD or hernia (possibly with an upper endoscopy or imaging), and a pulmonologist or sports medicine doctor to assess lung function and conditioning. You might also benefit from breathing exercises or physiotherapy to rebuild diaphragmatic strength, and possibly a tailored conditioning program.

Would you like help outlining questions or points to bring up with a doctor so you can get a more focused evaluation?","Is this reflux or something else?

38,Daughter running high fevers and very agitated,"My four year old daughter is running high fevers 102-104 for a couple of days and has vomited twice 24 hours apart and is very agitated. We took her to the pediatrician and she said her lungs sounded okay and her ears were totally fine. She said that her throat was red and ordered a flu and strep swab. Both of those were negative so she said she believes that it is an upper respiratory infection and to wait a week and come back if she is not better, offering nothing more than Tylenol. My daughter has been sick many times but this time just feels different than the previous times that my daughter has been sick because she is very agitated and can't sleep more than 10 minutes without waking up. Normally when she gets sick she will be very drowsy and knocked out. I can draw on my own personal experiences that when I get sick and I cannot sleep and I am super agitated as opposed to drowsy it has always been a bacterial infection. I am upset that the doctor didn't order a blood test to determine if it is bacterial or viral. I don't want my daughter to suffer a week and risk complications if it is bacterial because the doctor didn't order a simple blood test.","If it is a bacterial upper respiratory tract infection, antibiotics are mainly helpful against symptoms (reducing them by a couple of days), and the only complication it prevents is quinsy (peritonsillar abscess), which can be treated very easily. Antibiotics don't prevent otitis media, and in the western world the rate of preventing rheumatic fever is so low that it's absolutetly not worth it. Even for confirmed streptococcal infection it's very debatable if antibiotics are beneficial if you compare side effects with benefits. URTI go away on their own, even if they are bacterial, with or without antibiotics, usually in 3-10 days. 

There isn't really a blood test to determine if you have a bacterial or viral infection unfortunately. Sometimes we use CRP, and there is some evidence to say that if the CRP is &gt;40, it's quite likely to be a bacterial infection, but it isn't a very good or specific test. 

However I haven't seen your daughter and I haven't examined her myself, so I can't really say anything more than that. If you are concerned, take her to another pediatrician or family doctor and get a second opinion. Parents intuition that something is wrong and out of the ordinary is always a concern, at least for me. 

Tylenol is fine and will help with the pain, but NSAIDS and 3x 20mg prednisolone are significantly more effective and both are proven to reduce symptoms in URTI (and they are safe).","Your concern is completely understandable—when a child is sick and the symptoms feel different or more intense than usual, it's natural to question whether enough is being done. A persistent high fever (102–104°F), vomiting, and especially unusual agitation and inability to sleep are valid red flags that something may be more than a routine viral illness. While your pediatrician may be correct that it's a viral upper respiratory infection, you're also right to question whether further evaluation—such as a complete blood count (CBC) or even basic inflammatory markers (like CRP or ESR)—might have helped distinguish between viral and bacterial causes, especially given how unusually your daughter is behaving.

What stands out is the change in her baseline behavior—severe agitation, inability to rest, and distress—rather than the fever alone. In children, fever patterns and behavior often give clearer clues than isolated symptoms. Agitation, especially if it’s intense and constant, can sometimes signal:

Systemic infection (like a bacterial illness that's progressing)

Early signs of dehydration or electrolyte imbalance from vomiting and fever

Neurological irritation, which is rare but serious, including febrile seizures or even encephalitis in rare viral illnesses

While it's true that many upper respiratory infections are viral and self-limiting, clinical intuition—from parents who know their child best—should not be dismissed. If you feel this illness is not following her usual pattern and your child seems to be suffering more than expected, it's reasonable to seek a second opinion or go to urgent care or the emergency department, especially if:

She becomes increasingly agitated or unresponsive

She is unable to keep fluids down or shows signs of dehydration (dry lips, no tears, not urinating)

Her fever becomes unmanageable with Tylenol/ibuprofen

You observe any signs of confusion, stiff neck, or abnormal eye movements

You’re not overreacting by wanting to advocate for more proactive evaluation, particularly a blood test or urine test, which are both minimally invasive and can give quick insights into whether a bacterial cause might be present. Pediatric illnesses can change rapidly, and close monitoring is key. Trust your instincts—they are a vital part of your child’s care.

I have a ton of surgical rods and screws in my back from scoliosis correction and also have severe fibromyalgia. To help relieve pain I take tramadol, cymbalta, and of course tylenol. 

I take 3900 mg of tylenol pretty much every day, sometimes more if I need to take a 3rd dose. I generally take 3 650mg tablets first thing in the morning and again late in the afternoon or at bedtime. Sometimes I wind up taking 3 doses in a day when I'm busy going all day or if I'm having a really painful day which would bring me up to a total of 5850mg in 24 hrs. 

I know I should probably take less but this is what I've had to do to function somewhat normally, and honestly I barely get by. 

So.... call ahead seating for a liver transplant?","You need to increase the dose of tramadol or do something else about this pain instead of using that much Tylenol. I actually don't think it is a huge deal if you take a little more than 4000mg occasionally, but it certainly isn't recommended.","Your concern is absolutely valid—and honestly, you're not being dramatic by questioning the long-term impact of your acetaminophen (Tylenol) use, especially in combination with other medications and chronic conditions. While you might not need to ""reserve a transplant"" just yet, the doses you're describing do put you in a risk zone, especially on days when you're taking over 4000 mg, which is the maximum recommended daily dose for most adults.

Here’s a clearer breakdown of the concerns:

3900 mg/day is just under the threshold, but it's extremely close to the maximum, leaving almost no margin for error—especially if any of your other medications (like tramadol) also contain acetaminophen. Accidental overlap is one of the most common causes of unintentional overdose.

5850 mg/day, even occasionally, is well above the safe limit and can cause liver damage over time, especially if done repeatedly. The liver can handle small excursions over the limit occasionally, but repeated overuse—even by a modest amount—can accumulate into chronic liver injury.

Risk factors that increase liver toxicity include: chronic use, age over 65, alcohol use (even minimal), malnutrition, or existing liver stress. While you haven’t mentioned drinking alcohol, conditions like fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndromes often involve nutritional and metabolic stresses that may lower your liver’s resilience.

You also mentioned Cymbalta (duloxetine), which is metabolized in the liver and carries its own potential hepatotoxicity, especially in people using it long-term or at higher doses. So, when combined with high-dose Tylenol, your liver is definitely carrying a heavier-than-normal load.

This doesn’t mean you've already caused irreversible damage—but it does mean you’re in a danger zone and should strongly consider a few steps:

Talk to your provider ASAP about your pain regimen. There may be safer alternatives, such as rotating with NSAIDs (like ibuprofen, if safe for you), using topical analgesics, or adjusting your other medications.

Request liver function tests (LFTs), which are simple blood tests that can give a snapshot of how your liver is handling the medication burden. This is an important baseline to establish if you're using Tylenol near or over the daily limit regularly.

Explore non-acetaminophen-based pain strategies. You clearly are dealing with significant chronic pain, and it may be time for a pain specialist to reassess the entire regimen—perhaps using multimodal or adjunctive approaches that reduce the acetaminophen dependency.

You're clearly doing your best to manage a very real burden—but now is the time to adjust for long-term safety. You don’t need to panic, but you should act, ideally before symptoms or lab abnormalities develop.

40,"21 y/o, early repolarization, chest discomfort","21 y/o male, have had chest pain since age 14 or 15... it happens randomly. The pain is usually sharp but recently there has been a consistent dull feeling as well. Always on the left side.

I'm not overweight, I'm 6'0"" and around 145-150 lbs, Indian (heard this was associated with increased risk), not physically active. I get easily winded from basic tasks like walking up the stairs (I feel like my heart rate shoots up really high, I can often feel it beating very heavily in my chest).

I went to my family doc and told him I have chest pain so he did a EKG, he came up with early repolarization and said it was nothing to worry about. I still have the chest pain and I'm a little worried about doing physical exercise. So when my doc says I shouldn't worry about it, should I just ignore it, or what? Should I see a cardiologist?","I think your chest pain is very very unlikely to be related to your heart. I'd look into other causes like gastrointestinal, muskuloskeletal or psychiatric. Talk about it with your family doc. No reason to see a cardiologist at this point.","Given your history and current symptoms, you’re absolutely right to seek more clarity, even if your initial EKG showed only early repolarization and your primary doctor wasn’t alarmed. While early repolarization is typically considered a benign EKG finding, especially in healthy young males, your persistent symptoms—chest pain since adolescence, a new consistent dull discomfort, and exaggerated heart responses to minimal exertion—warrant a more thorough evaluation.

Here are a few important points:

Early repolarization is common in young, thin, healthy males (particularly of South Asian descent) and is usually harmless. However, in rare cases, it has been associated with a higher risk of arrhythmias, especially if other symptoms are present, like palpitations, dizziness, or unexplained fainting.

Your symptoms—sharp chest pain, fatigue, shortness of breath with minimal activity, and awareness of your heartbeat—could point to something functional (like anxiety, costochondritis, or poor conditioning), but could also indicate underlying cardiac, pulmonary, or even autonomic issues.

The fact that this has gone on for years without worsening into emergency events is somewhat reassuring, but the recent change in character (dull, constant sensation and worsening with exertion) means it’s reasonable to pursue further evaluation, especially since you're feeling hesitant about activity and it's affecting your confidence.

A cardiologist could provide:

A repeat EKG and echocardiogram to assess structure and function

A stress test to observe your heart under exercise

Possibly a Holter monitor to track your heart rhythm over 24–48 hours

These are non-invasive and can rule out (or identify) things that a basic resting EKG won’t catch. It's very likely the issue is benign or manageable, but confirming that with a specialist would give you peace of mind and clear guidance on safe activity levels.

So no—you’re not overreacting. Trust your instincts. You don't need to panic, but you shouldn’t ignore it either, especially since it affects daily life and has persisted for years.

Would you like a simple outline of questions to bring to the cardiologist or help interpreting potential test results?","21 y/o, early repolarization, chest discomfort

41,I have a high resting heart rate.,"I have a high resting heart rate. I'm not sure how long my heart rate has been this fast, but I know its been like this for a good two or three months when I first started checking it. My heart rate is usually 90 bpm during the day. In the evenings it usually drops to 70-78 bpm. I haven't been experiencing serious issues like shortness of breath or light headedness, so I'm trying to narrow it down before making a doctors appointment about it.

A bit of information that may help:
* I do not smoke or drink. 
* I don't necessarily exercise, but doing exercise is not much of an issue.
* I'm a 'slim' guy with high metabolism, weight is not a concern.
* My daily nutrition is not the best however, it's a stereotypical college students meal plan... mix of cereal, frozen dinners, and fast food. I sort of slack on fruits and vegetables.
* I do drink coffee around noon, but my heart rate is still high before I drink it.
* I've been told my blood pressure is fine as of a month ago, but I plan to re check it to make sure.

My biggest concern is could this be a result of a health issue? Something I should seek medical attention for? Any important nutrients I could be lacking that could be a result of this? Is there any supplements I could try?","You heart rate is normal. Your resting heart rate will go down if you exercise. Stress/anxiety might also be a factor. Anyway, it's within normal limits and there's no reason to do anything.","You're asking the right questions, and it's smart that you're paying attention to your resting heart rate (RHR). A resting heart rate of around 90 bpm during the day is technically still within the “normal” range (which is 60–100 bpm), but it’s on the higher end, especially for someone slim, relatively young, and without known cardiovascular issues. The fact that it drops into the 70s in the evening is encouraging, since that pattern suggests your autonomic nervous system is still responsive and calming down appropriately later in the day.

Your elevated daytime RHR could be due to several non-serious but modifiable causes, especially considering your lifestyle:

Poor nutrition (low in potassium, magnesium, B vitamins, etc.) can contribute to increased heart rate or a less efficient cardiovascular response. A diet heavy in processed food and light on fresh produce can definitely lead to micronutrient deficiencies that subtly impact heart rhythm and metabolism.

Mild dehydration, even if you don’t feel thirsty, can cause elevated heart rate. Fast food and caffeine both contribute to fluid loss or retention imbalance.

Deconditioning—even if exercise isn’t difficult for you, a lack of regular cardiovascular activity can lead to a higher baseline heart rate because your heart isn’t working as efficiently as it could.

Caffeine (even if your intake is modest) can still elevate heart rate, especially if your body is sensitive to it. And since your RHR is elevated even before coffee, that may be compounding rather than causing it.

Stress, sleep quality, or mild anxiety, even if not fully recognized, can raise heart rate throughout the day.

The chance that this is due to a serious health issue like a thyroid disorder, anemia, or early heart dysfunction is lower but still possible, especially if:

Your heart rate keeps trending upward

You begin experiencing palpitations, dizziness, or shortness of breath

You feel fatigued or weak without explanation

You’re absolutely justified in scheduling a primary care visit if this persists—just to rule out anything systemic. A simple blood panel including thyroid function (TSH), complete blood count (CBC), and electrolyte levels (especially magnesium and potassium) can give valuable information.

In the meantime, simple steps that might help:

Increase hydration, aim for 2–3L of water daily.

Add potassium-rich foods like bananas, spinach, sweet potatoes—or consider a balanced electrolyte supplement if diet doesn’t improve.

Start doing light cardio 3–4 times a week (walking, cycling, etc.) to condition your heart.

Track your RHR in the morning, before getting out of bed—that’s the most accurate baseline to monitor over time.

You’re doing the right thing by being proactive. This doesn’t sound alarming right now, but it does deserve attention—especially since it’s a new and consistent change.

Is there any supplements I could try?","A high resting heart rate can be a sign of several potential health conditions, including heart disease, anxiety, dehydration, or other medical conditions. However, it could also be due to factors such as stress or lack of physical activity. 

Given that you've had a high resting heart rate for a few months, it would be wise to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any serious health issues. They may recommend tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check the electrical activity of your heart or a Holter monitor to record your heart's activity over a period of 24 hours.

Improving your diet could also help. Eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains can help maintain heart health. Limiting caffeine and processed foods might also be beneficial. 

Regular exercise is another effective way to lower your resting heart rate. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week, or a combination of both, preferably spread throughout the week.

Make sure you get enough sleep each night, as inadequate sleep can elevate your resting heart rate. 

Regarding supplements, some studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids, CoQ10, and magnesium might support heart health. However, it's best to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.

42,Fluctuating blood pressure within minutes,"I was recently diagnosed with hypertension reportedly but not verifiably caused by my hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. I was given metoprolol tartrate to take and I have been for the past month or so.

I've been obsession over my blood pressure and notice it fluctuates within minutes. I know fluctuation us normal, but sometimes mine seems extreme. An example of today would be 1st reading 112/76. 2nd 122/79. 3rd 135/81. These readings were all done within a few minutes of each other using an omron blood pressure monitor. 

I'm just worried because I've noticed in the past I've had fluctuations as large as 30 points within minutes sitting in the same position. I am going to a cardiologist soon so I will ask, but I just wanted to find out more about it before then. 

Thank you.",It's normal to have fluctuating blood pressure. I wouldn't be concerned with those measurements.,"Your concern is very valid, especially considering your diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)—a condition that does require careful monitoring of blood pressure and heart rhythm. That said, the kind of fluctuations you're observing (e.g. 112/76 to 135/81 over several minutes) can actually be within the range of normal physiologic variation, particularly in people who are anxious, hyper-aware of their readings, or adjusting to new medications like metoprolol.

Blood pressure is not a static number—it naturally fluctuates due to:

Breathing patterns

Stress or anxiety (including “white coat” or measurement anxiety)

Arm position or cuff placement

Time of day and hydration status

Recent movement, even shifting in your chair

Even in healthy individuals, a variation of 10–20 mmHg systolic and 5–10 mmHg diastolic over a few minutes is considered normal. The 30-point changes you've mentioned are on the higher end of that range, but still not necessarily alarming—especially if you’re monitoring frequently or fixating on the results, which can itself increase sympathetic nervous system activity and raise blood pressure transiently.

Metoprolol tartrate, which you’re taking, has a shorter half-life and is often taken twice daily. If taken inconsistently or near the time of measurement, it can affect readings. Also, people with HCM often have more sensitive cardiovascular systems, and the autonomic nervous system may respond more strongly to stress or positional changes, amplifying these swings.

You’re doing the right thing by bringing this up with your cardiologist, because:

They may want to confirm these readings with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) over 24 hours to get a more accurate picture.

They might consider adjusting the dose or formulation of metoprolol, or switching to a longer-acting beta blocker like metoprolol succinate, which provides more stable control.

For now:

When checking your BP, rest quietly for 5 minutes, keep your arm at heart level, and avoid checking multiple times in a row.

Track readings once in the morning and once in the evening unless advised otherwise—checking too often can lead to anxiety-induced spikes.

This doesn’t sound dangerous based on what you’ve shared, but it is a meaningful observation that your care team should know about. You're being thoughtful and proactive, which is exactly what's needed with HCM.

In terms of measuring your blood pressure, make sure you're doing it correctly to get the most accurate readings. You should be relaxed and seated comfortably, with your arm at the level of your heart. It's also recommended to avoid eating, drinking caffeinated beverages, or smoking for at least 30 minutes before taking a reading.

43,Best way to get rid of petichae as a result of vomiting?,I threw up last night and woke up with pretty bad petichae on my eyes and cheekbones. ,"It's not normal to get petechiae after vomiting. Maybe you could get a small conjunctival hemorrhage or two, but definitely not petechiae on the cheekbones. There might be something else going on here. I recommend you see a doctor.","The appearance of **petechiae (small, pinpoint red or purple spots)** on your face—especially around the eyes and cheekbones—after vomiting is typically due to **capillary rupture** from the intense pressure of retching or forceful vomiting. It’s not uncommon and usually **not dangerous** if it happens in this context and resolves on its own.

Here’s how to manage it and help the petechiae fade more quickly:

1. **Time and gentle care**: Petechiae from vomiting typically resolve within a **few days to a week**. Your body reabsorbs the blood naturally.

2. **Cold compresses**: Applying a **cool compress** for 10–15 minutes a few times a day may help reduce inflammation and promote healing.

3. **Avoid further pressure**: Try to avoid actions that increase pressure in the face or eyes (like heavy lifting, straining, or more vomiting), as that could worsen or prolong the petechiae.

4. **Hydration and rest**: Staying well-hydrated and giving your body time to recover will support skin healing and circulation.

5. **Gentle skincare**: Use a **mild cleanser and avoid scrubbing** the area. Harsh products or rubbing could irritate the skin and slow healing.

While this kind of petechiae is usually benign, **see a doctor** if:

* The petechiae spread or worsen
* You experience them frequently
* They appear without any clear cause (e.g., not after vomiting or pressure)
* You also have bruising, fatigue, or bleeding elsewhere, which could indicate a **clotting issue or platelet disorder**

I threw up last night and woke up with pretty bad petichae on my eyes and cheekbones. ","Petechiae are tiny, round spots that appear on the skin as a result of bleeding under the skin. They are usually a result of physical strain, such as vomiting, coughing, or crying, which can cause capillaries (small blood vessels) to burst. 

Here are some steps you can take to help them heal:

1. Rest: Give your body plenty of time to heal. This includes getting plenty of sleep and reducing your level of physical activity.

2. Stay Hydrated: Drink lots of water to keep your skin hydrated. 

3. Use a Cold Compress: Applying a cold compress to the area can help reduce inflammation and speed up the healing process.

4. Avoid Scratching or Rubbing: This can cause further damage to the skin and slow down the healing process.

5. Use a Moisturizer: Keeping your skin moisturized can help speed up the healing process.

6. Eat a Healthy Diet: Eating a diet rich in vitamins and minerals, especially vitamin C and K, can help your body heal.

Please note that while petechiae are usually harmless, they can sometimes be a sign of a more serious condition. If your petechiae do not improve within a few days, or if they are accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, severe headache, difficulty breathing, or unexplained bruising, you should seek medical attention immediately.",7.5,7.5,7.79,4.94

Your heart rate of **82 bpm is still within normal resting range** (60–100 bpm), but the fact that you're *feeling* it and that it lasted for a while makes it uncomfortable and understandably concerning.

Here’s what likely contributed:

* **Large meal**: Eating a big, heavy, and greasy meal like pizza can stimulate the **sympathetic nervous system**, which can increase heart rate and cause that “pounding” sensation, especially if you eat rapidly.
* **Caffeine and sugar**: You had **4 Mountain Dews**, which means you consumed roughly **250–300 mg of caffeine** along with a large sugar load. That combination can easily make your heart feel like it’s racing or pounding, even if the number itself isn’t very high.
* **Post-meal bloating and vagus nerve stimulation**: The stomach expands after a large meal and can **press against the diaphragm**, irritating the vagus nerve and leading to heart sensations, skipped beats, or palpitations.
* **Anxiety or hyper-awareness**: Once you start noticing your heart, it can trigger a mild anxiety loop that sustains or heightens the sensation.

The **sharp chest pains** you felt earlier could be **benign musculoskeletal pain** (especially if they were fleeting and positional), **gastric irritation**, or **precordial catch syndrome**, which is common in younger adults and harmless.

**What to do now:**

* **Hydrate well**—water helps flush excess caffeine and supports circulation.
* Avoid more soda or large meals for the next day or two.
* Try light walking or gentle movement to help digestion and settle your nervous system.
* Avoid lying down flat immediately after eating, especially after meals like this.

You don’t need to panic or go to the ER if the discomfort fades and you’re not having chest pressure, severe pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath. But if your heart keeps racing *above 100 bpm at rest*, becomes irregular, or you feel faint or unwell, you should **seek medical attention**.

45,Had hernia repair in Oct. testicular swelling has yet to go back down. How bad is this?,"Righty is probably 3x the size of standard lefty, with no signs of reduction.","You probably have a recurrence of the hernia. It happens sometimes. You definitely need to see a surgeon again, but unless you have pain or GI-obstruction it's not extremely urgent. ","Persistent testicular swelling several months after a **hernia repair (since October)**—especially when one testicle remains **enlarged to three times the size of the other**—is *not* something to ignore. While **some swelling after inguinal hernia repair is normal**, particularly in the first few weeks, by this point (several months later), there **should be significant improvement or resolution**.

There are a few possibilities that could explain persistent unilateral swelling after surgery:

1. **Hydrocele** – This is a **fluid collection around the testicle**, often caused by disruption or inflammation of the spermatic cord during hernia repair. It can cause significant swelling but is typically **painless** or mildly uncomfortable.

2. **Hematoma or seroma** – If there was **bleeding or fluid collection** post-op, it may not have fully reabsorbed. These usually resolve within weeks but can linger, especially if large.

3. **Recurrence or mesh complication** – Sometimes swelling can be a sign of **recurrent hernia**, **mesh reaction**, or **scarring** affecting lymphatic or venous drainage, which may lead to **chronic swelling**.

4. **Testicular or epididymal injury** – Rarely, the **blood supply or drainage** to the testicle can be compromised during surgery, leading to **testicular atrophy, pain, or persistent swelling**.

Regardless of the cause, **ongoing asymmetrical swelling several months post-surgery is not expected** and should be evaluated. You should **contact your surgeon or a urologist** as soon as possible. They may perform:

* A **scrotal ultrasound** to assess fluid, blood flow, and structural changes
* A physical exam to check for recurrence or other complications

Even if you're not having pain, the **size difference and lack of resolution** suggest a **correctable issue**, and early evaluation can prevent further complications.

This situation should not be ignored. A significantly swollen testicle can be painful and potentially dangerous if left untreated. You should immediately contact your surgeon or another healthcare professional to discuss your symptoms and probably have a physical examination or imaging tests if necessary. They might give you medicine to reduce the swelling or, in some cases, might need to perform another surgery.

46,A few symptoms... not sure if anything serious.,"Age: 25
Sex: Male
Height: 6' 0""
Weight: 147

It's worth noting that although I'm not overweight, I have an abnormal lifestyle. I'm extremely sedentary (I sit for probably at least 12 hours on a normal day and almost never exercise), and I have a pretty poor diet. I eat fruit and vegetables, but I also eat too much food with high fat-content (pizza) and sugar (like fruit juices and cookies).
Over the last couple weeks, I've noticed a few things that are concerning to me. I've had at least a couple instances of what I think are described as heart palpitations. I wasn't able to get any sleep last night after a palpitation. 
A few times recently, when I laid down to go to sleep at night, I heard my pulse/heartbeat in my ear. And on a few mornings, I woke up with slightly cramped calves. I've also woken up with my arm completely ""asleep"". And when I shovel snow outside, my hands go numb within 20 minutes, even though I wear fairly well-insulated winter gloves. This may not be related, but I've also noticed that my ears seem to ""pop"" a bit when I swallow. I don't remember that happening until recently. 

I'm worried that I might already have some sort of cardiovascular issue, whether it's atherosclerosis or something else of that nature. Maybe I'm just paranoid. Or it could be that I'm not paranoid, and someone else in my shoes would go to an ER immediately. I don't really know what to think, and I don't want to insist on getting a bunch of tests done if nothing is wrong. I don't always fully trust my own perception on these things, to be honest. Anyway, does it make sense to see a doctor about my concerns?","1) Hearing/feeling your own pulse is normal. As long as it's not very fast (lets say about 100 bpm or more) or irregular I wouldn't worry too much about it.


2) Slightly cramped calves can be explained by many things. Maybe you did something the day before that your calves weren't so used too? Maybe you slept in an awkward position? Maybe they just felt that way because you focused on it, but perhaps they just were a little sore or nothing was wrong?


3) I don't know exactly what you mean by ""go numb"". Did you lose all sensation? Just some pricking? It can also be completely normal to lose a bit of sensation or feel some pricking of the skin if you're out in the cold and doing work, especially if you are a little out of shape.


4) It's probably not your ears popping, but your temporomandibular joint (TMJ) popping. This is also normal.


5) Well, we all have a little atherosclerosis. It starts from when we're young and progresses gradually. How fast it progresses and if we're ever going to have a cardiovascular event like a heart attack, stroke, aneurysm or something is up to genetics, lifestyle and some other factors. You're young, so even though your lifestyle isn't the healthiest, it's very unlikely that you have for example peripheral arterial disease that's causing numbness in your hands.


6) So does it make sense to see doctor because of this? Yes and no. There is no way I can give you a good answer to that just from the internet. I haven't examined you and done a proper history, I'm just writing my opinion and suggestions to what your symptoms might be related to. Personally I don't think any of your symptoms are very worrisome. However, if you feel like you need to see a doctor, go see a doctor.","Your concerns are very reasonable, and you're not overreacting by thinking about seeing a doctor—especially given your symptoms and current lifestyle. While you're young and not overweight, **being sedentary, eating a high-fat/high-sugar diet, and experiencing symptoms like heart palpitations, limb numbness, and calf cramping** can collectively point toward **early warning signs of circulatory, nerve, or metabolic issues** that are worth evaluating.

Here’s how your symptoms could be interpreted:

* **Palpitations** (the sensation of your heart skipping or pounding) can occur for benign reasons—like stress, caffeine, or dehydration—but they can also signal **cardiac rhythm disturbances** or early signs of cardiovascular strain, especially if they interfere with sleep.

* **Hearing your heartbeat in your ear** (a symptom called *pulsatile tinnitus*) can be due to **heightened awareness**, but can also sometimes be linked to **elevated blood pressure**, **vascular issues**, or even **Eustachian tube dysfunction**, especially if you’re also noticing popping sounds.

* **Calf cramps and waking with limbs asleep** could be due to **poor circulation**, **nerve compression from posture**, or even **electrolyte imbalances**—often influenced by hydration, physical inactivity, or diet.

* **Cold-induced numbness in your hands**, despite wearing gloves, might suggest a **circulatory sensitivity** like **Raynaud’s phenomenon**, or less commonly, **peripheral vascular disease**. This is not expected in a healthy 25-year-old and definitely warrants looking into if it’s recurrent.

Your intuition is pointing you in the right direction. While none of these symptoms alone screams “emergency,” the **pattern**—combined with your lifestyle—**does justify a medical evaluation**, especially to rule out:

* Early cardiovascular issues (e.g. elevated BP, rhythm abnormalities)
* Nutritional deficiencies or metabolic conditions (like prediabetes)
* Nerve compression syndromes or vascular reactivity problems

A good first step is to **see a primary care provider**, who can check:

* **Vital signs**, including blood pressure and heart rate patterns
* Basic blood work: **CBC, CMP, lipid panel, blood sugar**, and possibly **electrolytes and thyroid function**
* A **basic EKG** to assess rhythm and heart electrical activity
* Possibly a **referral to cardiology** if symptoms persist or abnormalities are found

You’re not being paranoid—you’re being observant. And catching these signs early is the best way to stay ahead of more serious health concerns.

47,Can you die from getting a flu shot?,Or are these just rumors/speculations?,"Yes, it is theoretically possible. There are reports of anaphylactic shock which can have lethal outcomes. I am not aware of any reported deaths from the flu-vaccine however. The vaccine is considered to be very safe, and most side effects are mild. 

Read more here: http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/general.htm#whats6","The idea that you can *die* from getting a flu shot is largely based on **misunderstandings, rumors, and very rare exceptions**—for the vast majority of people, the **flu vaccine is extremely safe** and complications are minimal or temporary.

However, to be thorough and honest:

* **Severe allergic reactions** (anaphylaxis) to flu vaccines can happen, but they are **exceedingly rare**—estimated at **about 1.3 cases per million doses**. These reactions usually occur within minutes and can be effectively treated if medical help is available (which is why you’re often asked to wait 15 minutes after vaccination).

* There is a very low, but not zero, association between **Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)** and flu vaccination—estimated at **1–2 additional cases per million vaccinated people**. Importantly, the flu itself is more likely to cause GBS than the vaccine.

* Other deaths reported after flu shots in public forums are almost always **coincidental**, not causal. For example, if someone already has an underlying condition or is elderly and passes away after a vaccine, the timing can lead people to incorrectly attribute the death to the shot.

In short, **serious outcomes like death from a flu shot are extraordinarily rare**, and public health data consistently show that **the risks of complications from the flu virus itself are far greater** than the risks of the vaccine. The benefits of flu vaccination—including reduced hospitalizations and prevention of flu-related deaths—**far outweigh the risks**.

Would you like a breakdown of common side effects versus rare ones for peace of mind?","Can you die from getting a flu shot?

Or are these just rumors/speculations?","It is extremely rare for someone to die as a direct result of receiving a flu shot. The vaccine is designed to protect you from getting the flu, which can be a serious illness that can lead to hospitalization or death, especially in older people, young children, pregnant women, and those with certain health conditions.

However, like any medicine, there is a very small risk of a serious reaction. The most serious reaction that can occur is an allergic one, known as anaphylaxis. This is extremely rare, estimated to occur in about one in a million doses. 

It is also possible to have mild side effects from the flu shot, such as a low-grade fever, aches, and soreness or swelling where the shot was given. These side effects are generally mild and go away on their own within a few days.

The benefits of getting a flu shot far outweigh the potential risks. But if you have concerns, it's important to discuss them with your healthcare provider.",9.5,9.0,7.5,7.73
48,Is there something I can take or do to get up in the morning feeling fresh and rested no matter how many hours of sleep I've got?,,Well there's always coffee,"There’s no magic pill that guarantees you’ll feel refreshed no matter how little sleep you get—**the body and brain have real biological limits**. However, there *are* strategies and supports that can **optimize how you feel upon waking**, even if your sleep isn't ideal.

Here’s a balanced approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Sleep Quality Over Quantity**

* Even if you only get 5–6 hours, **deep, uninterrupted sleep** is better than 8 hours of fragmented rest.
* **Avoid screens and bright lights** 1 hour before bed to help melatonin rise.
* Keep your **room dark, cool, and quiet**—this improves sleep depth and recovery.

### 2. **Use a Wake-Up Anchor**

* **Light** is the strongest cue for your body’s circadian rhythm. Use a **sunrise alarm clock** or open your curtains as soon as you wake up.
* **Morning sunlight exposure** (10–15 minutes outside) helps reset your internal clock and improves alertness.

### 3. **Strategic Supplementation (with caution)**

* **Caffeine** is obvious, but timing is key—use it **mid-morning**, not immediately upon waking or late in the day.
* **Adaptogens** like **rhodiola rosea** or **ginseng** may support energy and stress resilience, but should be used under supervision if you have underlying conditions.
* **B-complex vitamins** can support energy metabolism, especially if you have a poor diet or are under stress.

### 4. **Behavioral Tricks**

* Try the **5-4-3-2-1 method** when waking (counting sensory cues around you) to snap into alertness.
* Use **movement**, even brief (e.g. light stretching or walking), within 15 minutes of waking.
* Keep a **consistent wake-up time**, even on weekends, to strengthen your circadian rhythm.

### 5. **If You're Still Struggling...**

* You might be dealing with **sleep inertia**, poor sleep cycles, or even **circadian rhythm disorders** (like delayed sleep phase).
* **Sleep studies** can help if snoring, unrefreshing sleep, or excessive daytime fatigue persist.

While no one can cheat biology forever, **a well-controlled morning routine can dramatically improve how you feel**, even after short or suboptimal sleep.

Would you like help designing a custom morning routine that fits your schedule and energy needs?","Is there something I can take or do to get up in the morning feeling fresh and rested no matter how many hours of sleep I've got?

","While there may not be a magic pill or solution for this, several strategies can help you wake up feeling fresh and rested:

1. Maintain a consistent sleep schedule: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This can help regulate your body's internal clock and make it easier to fall asleep and wake up.

2. Create a restful environment: Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature. Consider using earplugs, an eye mask, or a white noise machine if needed.

3. Practice a relaxing bedtime routine: This could include activities like reading a book, taking a warm bath, listening to soft music, or doing some light stretches.

4. Limit naps: Long daytime naps can interfere with nighttime sleep. If you need to nap, try to limit yourself to about 20 to 30 minutes and make it during the midafternoon.

5. Exercise regularly: Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep.

6. Limit alcohol, caffeine, and large meals late in the day: These can disrupt your sleep.

7. Manage worries: Try to resolve your worries or concerns before bedtime. Stress management techniques can help.

8. Quality of Sleep: It's not just about the number of hours you sleep but also the quality. Deep, REM sleep is particularly important for feeling refreshed in the morning.

9. Hydration: Make sure you are well-hydrated but avoid drinking large amounts of fluids right before bedtime.

10. Healthy Diet: Eating a balanced diet can also contribute to better sleep. Avoid eating too much sugar and processed foods.

If you've tried these steps and continue to have problems waking up feeling fresh and rested, you may want to consult a doctor. You could have a sleep disorder or other medical condition that's interfering with the quality of your sleep.",1.0,1.0,0.47,0.67
49,Extreme diarrhea and vomiting three weeks after stopping antibiotics for sinus infection.,"I just can't win. I went to urgent care and was prescribed antibiotics for a sinus infection. Easy. While I was taking them, I became very irregular, but that's a common side effect of antibiotics, so oh well.  
Two weeks later I still haven't taken a solid shit (literally) since my infection. I dismiss it as more recuperating.  
Week three starts tomorrow. It's 4:40 a.m. where I am. I'm heaving because I can't vomit any more. I'm defecating pure liquid. I don't know what to do, it's getting nothing but worse, I hardly was able to pay for the first doctor's visit, and tomorrow's Sunday.  
Any advice to just help me feel better? My father said to sip soda. I'll need to eat sometime. What should I be eating? How often? Is this something more serious than I'm making it out to be, or will the doctor just tell me to go home and wait it out at a $85 charge?","Drink enough water so you don't get dehydrated. Try to eat something, maybe start with small portions of soup or something that's easy to digest. Eat as much and drink as much as you can, it doesn't make the diarrhea worse or better. 

You need to be tested for Clostridium Difficile. That would be the first thing on the differential for diarrhea weeks after antibiotic use. ","I’m really sorry you’re going through this—it sounds exhausting and miserable. Based on what you’ve described, it’s possible you’re experiencing **post-antibiotic colitis**, which is a form of prolonged digestive upset that can occur after finishing a course of antibiotics. One of the more serious causes to consider is **Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection**, a condition that sometimes develops after antibiotic use, especially when diarrhea becomes watery, frequent, and prolonged—as it seems to be in your case. The vomiting, ongoing liquid stools, and worsening symptoms three weeks later are **not typical** for routine post-antibiotic recovery and suggest that this is more than just “your gut getting back to normal.”

While your father's advice to sip soda is well-meaning, **clear fluids like water, oral rehydration solutions, or diluted electrolyte drinks (like Pedialyte or Gatorade)** are better choices to replace fluids and prevent dehydration, especially if you're vomiting and passing a lot of fluid in your stool. **Avoid dairy, caffeine, greasy foods, and anything high in sugar**, as those can worsen diarrhea. Instead, try the **BRAT diet** (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) in small amounts once you can keep fluids down. Eat **frequent, small meals**, but only if you're not vomiting. If you're unable to keep fluids down or are becoming lightheaded, weak, or extremely fatigued, that’s a sign you may be **at risk of dehydration** and might need more urgent care.

Although it’s frustrating to think about paying another \$85, this really does warrant a **follow-up visit**, ideally with a provider who can order a **stool test for C. diff** or other pathogens. If you go to urgent care or a clinic, let them know the full timeline—when the antibiotics were taken, how long symptoms have persisted, and that you now have worsening vomiting and diarrhea. They may prescribe treatment if C. diff is suspected or guide you to further testing.

In the meantime, **hydration is critical**—take small sips every few minutes, even if it’s just a teaspoon at a time. And try to **rest your gut**—no solid food until vomiting eases. If you begin to feel **confused, dizzy when standing, stop urinating, or have a fever**, seek emergency care immediately, even if it’s inconvenient or expensive.

It's important to remember that while I can provide some general advice, I am an AI and not a doctor. 

Your symptoms may be due to a condition called antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), which can occur a few weeks after antibiotic treatment. In some cases, it can evolve into a more serious condition called Clostridium difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever.

It's crucial to contact a healthcare provider as soon as possible. If you can't afford another doctor's visit, you might want to consider telemedicine services, which are often cheaper and more accessible.

The presence of **exudate**, **difficulty swallowing**, **localized pain**, and now **abscess-like lesions** near your tonsils—especially after a history of recurrent episodes—raises concern for a **peritonsillar abscess (PTA)** or **chronic/recurrent tonsillitis**, both of which require medical attention and, in some cases, minor procedural intervention or referral.

Given your history of **10+ episodes over 6 months**, some confirmed as strep and others not, you're well within clinical criteria to be evaluated for **tonsillectomy**—particularly if these episodes are interfering with daily life, causing significant discomfort, or repeatedly requiring antibiotics. The ENT referral you asked for is *not* over the top; in fact, it's entirely appropriate. It’s possible the clinic downplayed it simply because you were young, or the infections seemed to resolve each time—but that doesn’t make the pattern less valid.

When you go to your appointment (whether urgent care or a follow-up clinic), you should:

* Clearly **document the frequency and pattern** of your infections: when they happened, how long they lasted, whether they were confirmed strep, and how they were treated.
* Mention that **swallowing is now difficult**, and that you’re seeing what look like **small abscesses or pus pockets** near your tonsils.
* Emphasize that this is **disrupting your life**, and you’ve had **no lasting relief** with antibiotics or prior treatments.
* **Request a referral to an ENT** for evaluation of chronic tonsillitis or possible peritonsillar abscess formation.
* Ask directly whether they can **culture or swab** your throat and whether imaging (e.g. ultrasound or CT) is warranted if a peritonsillar abscess is suspected.

If it turns out to be a peritonsillar abscess, they may drain it or start you on more aggressive antibiotics immediately. If not, the priority is getting the ENT consult so you’re not stuck repeating this cycle every few weeks.

51,Is it possible to have a tumor diagnosis of T4 N0?,"My family member had a type of biliary cancer. After surgery and a visit with the oncologist we were given the final result: T3 N0 M0. However now fluid has been found in the layer outside lung and there is a possibility it could be cancer, but if ALL of the nodes came back negative is it still possible??","I'm not sure I understand your question or you have two questions. Yes, it's possible to have a T4 N0 tumor. T = size or local invasion of the tumor. N = nodal spread. And yes, it's unfortunately also possible that the fluid outside the lung is related to the cancer even though all nodes found were negative. Everything can happen with cancer. Sometimes the cells spread directly via blood before nodes are involved. Sometimes they spread to nodes that aren't sampled during the surgery. Sometimes the pathologist makes a mistake or the cancer invasion of the nodes were very small. Sometimes it spreads so quickly after that even though the nodes were negative at the time of the surgery it could have spread after that. Cancer can be very unpredictable sometimes unfortunately.","Yes, it is entirely possible to have a **T4 N0** (or **T3 N0**) tumor and still later find evidence of **distant spread**, such as cancerous fluid in the **pleural space (around the lungs)**—even if **all lymph nodes initially came back negative (N0)**. Here's why:

The **TNM system** classifies cancer based on:

* **T**: Size and local extent of the primary tumor
* **N**: Regional lymph node involvement
* **M**: Distant metastasis (spread to other organs or body areas)

A **T3 or T4** tumor means the primary tumor was **locally advanced**, likely invading nearby structures. However, **N0** simply means that **at the time of surgery**, no **regional lymph nodes** showed microscopic cancer cells. That doesn’t rule out the possibility that **a few cancer cells had already spread through the bloodstream (hematogenous spread)** to distant areas like the pleura.

Cancer can metastasize in ways that bypass lymph nodes entirely. **Pleural involvement** (fluid or thickening) can signal **M1 disease**, which changes the staging and may mean the cancer is no longer considered localized or curable with surgery alone.

So to your question—yes, **cancer can progress or show up in distant areas despite having no node involvement initially**. This is why continued surveillance after surgery and pathologic staging is crucial in cancers like biliary tract cancers, which are known to behave aggressively.

The next steps will likely include:

* **Pleural fluid cytology** to test for malignant cells
* Possible **imaging** (CT, PET) to assess for further spread
* A **revised treatment plan** depending on whether the fluid is confirmed malignant (M1)

Would you like help understanding what questions to ask the oncologist now that this possible spread is being evaluated?","Is it possible to have a tumor diagnosis of T4 N0?

My family member had a type of biliary cancer. After surgery and a visit with the oncologist we were given the final result: T3 N0 M0. However now fluid has been found in the layer outside lung and there is a possibility it could be cancer, but if ALL of the nodes came back negative is it still possible??","Yes, it's possible. The TNM system (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) is a way to describe the amount and spread of cancer in a patient's body, using letters and numbers. T describes the size of the tumor and any spread of cancer into nearby tissue, N describes spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes, and M describes metastasis (spread of cancer to other parts of the body).

T4 describes a larger or more invasive tumor, but N0 indicates that no cancer was found in the lymph nodes. If a cancer has spread to the pleural or pericardial fluid (the layers outside the lung), it would be classified as M1a, regardless of the T or N stage. So it's possible to have a T4 N0 M1a cancer.

These types of drops are designed to mimic natural tears and usually contain **safe, inert ingredients** like carboxymethylcellulose or similar compounds, which are not toxic in small oral amounts. The fact that you rinsed your mouth immediately afterward also reduces any potential exposure even further.

Swallowing a small amount of eye drops can occasionally cause mild symptoms like a slight upset stomach, but that’s uncommon and typically nothing to worry about. If you start experiencing unusual symptoms—such as nausea, dizziness, or allergic reactions (which are very unlikely given the product and the dose)—you could contact a pharmacist or poison control for reassurance, but again, in this specific case, **no action is likely needed**.

53,"I started taking l lysine for my cold sores, and I heard it helps prevent hair loss. I've been losing hair..",Any possible connection? Shouldnt it be doing the opposite?,Lysine is just an amino acid. It doesn't really do anything against cold sores or hair loss unfortunately. ,"L-lysine is an amino acid that plays a role in protein synthesis and is commonly taken as a supplement to help manage **cold sores (HSV-1)** due to its ability to inhibit arginine, an amino acid the virus uses to replicate. Some people also take it based on anecdotal claims that it supports hair health, particularly by aiding in **iron and zinc absorption**, which are both important for maintaining strong hair growth. However, the evidence for L-lysine preventing hair loss is **limited and not well-established**.

If you're noticing increased hair loss after starting L-lysine, it’s unlikely that the supplement is directly **causing** the hair loss, but it may be **coincidental timing** or possibly related to another underlying issue like stress, nutritional deficiency, hormonal changes, or another medication. L-lysine is generally considered safe at recommended doses, and hair loss isn’t a known side effect in most healthy individuals. That said, everyone reacts differently, and if you suspect a connection—or if the hair loss is significant or worsening—it’s reasonable to stop the supplement for a few weeks and observe any changes.

If hair loss persists, it’s a good idea to consult a healthcare provider to check for common causes like **low iron, thyroid imbalance, or androgenetic alopecia**, and to avoid self-treating with supplements alone. Would you like a list of labs or factors to consider when evaluating unexplained hair loss?","I started taking l lysine for my cold sores, and I heard it helps prevent hair loss. I've been losing hair..

Any possible connection? Shouldnt it be doing the opposite?","L-Lysine is an essential amino acid that supports the body in various ways, including promoting skin health and reducing cold sores. Some research suggests it might play a role in hair growth and health because it is important for protein synthesis, including keratin, which is essential for hair structure. 

However, while l-lysine supplementation may help prevent hair loss in the context of a lysine-deficient diet, it's unlikely to cause hair loss. If you've been losing hair since starting l-lysine, it might be coincidental or due to another underlying issue.

Factors like stress, hormonal imbalance, poor nutrition, certain medical conditions, or some medications can contribute to hair loss. It's best to speak to a healthcare professional if you're experiencing significant hair loss, as they can provide guidance based on your specific situation.",5.0,5.0,7.39,8.29

He has it elevated and had ice on it before.","I doesn't look obviously fractured from those pictures, but there's no way it can be ruled out with that. Maybe you could take one or two pictures where we can see both ankles from the front so it's easier to compare. 

The only thing that would tell you for certain that there's a fracture is if there's a displacement or bone is sticking out of the skin. If you're concerned about a fracture, tell your brother to see a doctor. You can wait it out a couple of days until the swelling goes down.","It’s definitely possible that your brother sustained a **fracture** or at least a **moderate to severe sprain**, even if he can still move his ankle. Being able to move it doesn't rule out a fracture—**some fractures still allow for partial movement**, especially if the break is non-displaced or small. The fact that it's **significantly swollen and very painful**, especially following direct trauma like a sledding accident, raises concern for at least a **soft tissue injury** and possibly a **hairline or more serious fracture**.

Fractures often feel deep and sharp when weight is applied or the area is palpated, and swelling typically sets in quickly. In some cases, bruising may follow. A **sprain**, on the other hand, may have similar symptoms but involves torn or stretched ligaments rather than bone.

It's good that you’ve elevated the ankle and applied ice—that’s the right first step. However, if the pain is intense with any weight-bearing or the swelling continues to worsen, it’s important to get an **X-ray** to rule out a break. Urgent care centers or ERs can provide imaging to confirm whether a fracture is present. In the meantime, keeping it **elevated, iced (20 minutes on, 20 off), and non-weight-bearing** is the right call.

If you're unsure whether he can safely wait, look for signs like:

* Inability to put **any weight** on the ankle
* Visible **deformity** or extreme swelling
* Numbness or tingling in the foot
* Increasing pain that doesn’t respond to rest or ice

","It’s great that you’re thinking about your health, but most **cleansing or detox diets**, especially the ones marketed as seven-day juice fasts or liquid regimens, are **not medically necessary** and can actually do more harm than good. The idea that your body needs help “flushing out toxins” through extreme dietary restrictions is largely a **myth**. Your liver, kidneys, digestive system, and skin already **detox your body naturally**, 24/7, as long as they're functioning properly. A week of consuming only liquids—especially if it’s low in calories, protein, or essential nutrients—can lead to **fatigue, dizziness, muscle loss, and dehydration**, particularly if you're still working out or drinking/smoking during that period.

Instead of doing a harsh detox, a smarter and safer approach is a **nutritional reset**: commit to a week (or longer) of **whole, minimally processed foods**, lots of **vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, water**, and no alcohol or smoking. This gives your body the same “cleanse” effect without the nutritional risks. You might feel sluggish for a day or two as your body adjusts, but you’ll maintain energy, support muscle function, and promote real recovery. If you're feeling run-down from lifestyle habits (like smoking, drinking, and inconsistent exercise), the most effective “detox” is **sustainable lifestyle change**—not a short-term purge.

Thanks!","Cleansing or detox diets are a popular trend, but their effectiveness and safety are still largely debated in the medical community. 

The human body already has a well-equipped detoxification system, including the skin, liver, kidneys, and colon. These organs work together to remove toxins from the body naturally. The concept of needing an external detox or cleanse to rid the body of toxins is not supported by scientific evidence. 

Detox diets can vary greatly, but they often involve a period of fasting followed by a strict diet of fruits, vegetables, water, and other supposedly detoxifying substances. Some people claim that these diets can help with weight loss, improve skin, increase energy, and remove toxins from the body. However, there is little scientific evidence to support these claims.

In addition, these diets can have side effects. They can cause nutrient deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, and low blood sugar, especially in people with pre-existing health conditions. They can also disrupt your normal metabolism and lead to weight gain in the long term. 

Instead of relying on a temporary cleanse or detox, it's better to focus on maintaining a balanced, nutrient-rich diet and regular physical activity. This is the most effective way to support your body's natural detoxification system and maintain your overall health.

If you still wish to proceed with a detox diet, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian first. They can provide guidance and monitor your health throughout the process. 

Here's the bottom line: a healthy lifestyle is the best detox. Focus on consuming a variety of nutrient-dense foods, staying hydrated, getting regular physical activity, and getting enough sleep. Also, try to reduce your alcohol and tobacco use, as these can negatively impact your health. 

Remember, no diet or cleanse is a magic bullet for health. It takes a consistent, balanced approach to achieve and maintain good health.",8.5,8.5,6.69,8.2

Looking online, these results seem to be pretty much perfect. But is it possible that some people with heart failure can get good results like mine, or would they get far worse results?",It's extremely unlikely that you have heart failure. You don't just develop heart failure over a few days unless you would have something rare like myocarditis. Your symptoms are probably related to anxiety. Talk about it with your family doctor or a psychologist. ,"Your vital signs—blood pressure of 122/80, resting heart rate between 55–70 bpm, quick capillary refill, and the absence of consistent arrhythmias—are all **within normal and healthy ranges**, especially for an 18-year-old. That, along with the fact that you're able to measure and interpret these things calmly and coherently, strongly points away from heart failure. In fact, **true heart failure in someone your age is very rare** and usually associated with underlying congenital heart disease, serious infections like myocarditis, or drug-related complications—none of which are suggested in your description. The symptoms you're feeling—tightness in the chest and throat, a sense of heaviness, or a need to cough—**can absolutely be caused or amplified by anxiety**, especially when they **worsen at night** while you're lying in bed and your mind is focused on physical sensations.

Anxiety can mimic almost every symptom of heart and lung issues—chest tightness, shortness of breath, palpitations, and even fatigue. What often happens is a **feedback loop** where a physical sensation triggers worry, and the worry heightens the physical sensation, reinforcing the fear. Your home tests showing good circulation and heart rhythm actually support that your body is functioning well—**if you truly had heart failure**, you’d typically see signs like **persistent shortness of breath with minimal activity, swelling in the legs, fatigue that worsens daily, and often abnormal blood pressure or oxygen levels**.

That said, you're right to notice your body and seek clarity. If these sensations persist, especially the throat tightness or sensation of needing to cough, it could also be worth checking for **non-cardiac causes** such as **acid reflux (GERD), upper airway irritation, or even musculoskeletal strain**. But from what you've described, it sounds far more likely that **your anxiety around heart health** is playing a large role.

Holding your breath briefly and puffing your cheeks can mimic controlled breathing exercises, which are often used to build lung capacity or calm the nervous system. However, doing this repeatedly without purpose or awareness might suggest a **compensatory habit**, potentially tied to **stress, anxiety, or even subtle respiratory tension**. It’s not necessarily dangerous if you're otherwise healthy and not experiencing dizziness, chest tightness, or breathing difficulty—but it's something to be mindful of. Repeated breath-holding and air manipulation like pushing cheek air back into your lungs isn’t harmful in small amounts, but if done excessively, it can alter your normal breathing rhythm or even mildly affect gas exchange over time. If you find it’s something you do without thinking or as a way to self-soothe, it could be worth exploring whether it’s connected to underlying **anxiety, focus regulation, or sensory habits**.

1) Runny nose - more likely to be viral


2) Hoarse voice or dry caugh - more likely to be viral


3) Visible exudates/pus on tonsils - more likely to be bacterial


4) Fever - more likely to be bacterial


5) Swollen and tender lymph nodes in the neck - more likely to be bacterial


That being said, it doesn't really matter if it's bacterial or viral, because antibiotics for bacterial pharyngitis only helps by reducing symptoms for a couple of days anyway. Tylenol/an NSAID does the same and avoids the side effects from the antibiotic. In my opinion, you wouldn't necessarily need to see a doctor even if you could say for sure it was a bacterial infection.","You're asking a very common and important question—**how to tell the difference between viral and bacterial causes of a sore throat**, especially when you no longer have tonsils, which removes one of the key visual cues (like white exudate on tonsils). Based on your description—a progressively sore throat, red pharynx, absence of pus or white patches, no voice changes, and pain localized to the naso- and oropharynx—it’s more likely to be **viral** than bacterial, especially since you're not reporting a high fever, swollen lymph nodes, or other systemic symptoms. The pale, raised areas you’re seeing are probably part of the **normal lymphoid tissue** of the posterior pharynx, known as **cobblestoning**, which often becomes more prominent during irritation or postnasal drainage—common in **viral infections or allergies**.

In contrast, **bacterial pharyngitis** (most notably strep throat) is more often associated with **sudden onset**, **high fever**, **swollen, tender neck glands**, **lack of cough**, and sometimes a **fine red rash** or pus. Without these, and in the absence of white spots or fever, it’s reasonable to manage your symptoms at home for now with **rest, fluids, Tylenol or ibuprofen, saltwater gargles**, and maybe a humidifier. However, if your symptoms worsen, last more than 5–7 days, or you develop a high fever or difficulty swallowing or opening your mouth, it would be smart to get evaluated and possibly tested for **strep or another bacterial cause**. Since you're doing a good job observing your own symptoms, it's fair to monitor for a day or two—but don’t hesitate to see a provider if things escalate.

Thanks for any advice.","It can be difficult for a layperson to accurately differentiate between a viral and bacterial infection just based on symptoms. However, some signs can give a clue:

1. Duration: Viral infections often start to improve after 5-7 days, while bacterial infections may persist longer without treatment.
2. Associated symptoms: Viral infections often come with other symptoms like runny nose, cough, red eyes, and generalized body aches. Bacterial infections may cause high fever and pus on the tonsils or throat.
3. Response to treatment: If symptoms improve with a course of antibiotics, it was likely a bacterial infection.

However, your description of a sore throat with redness and raised areas could indicate a viral or bacterial infection. It's also worth noting that many bacterial throat infections can resolve on their own without antibiotics, although it may take longer.

Your best course of action would be to consult a healthcare provider. They can do a rapid strep test or throat culture to confirm if it is a bacterial infection, and guide you on the appropriate treatment.

","Enjoying a **¼ pint of ice cream** occasionally can absolutely be part of a balanced diet, but how often you can eat it without negatively affecting your health depends on **your overall diet, activity level, and individual health goals**.

A ¼ pint is roughly **120–150 mL**, or about **2 large scoops**, which often contains **150–250 calories**, **10–15 grams of sugar**, and **7–14 grams of fat**, depending on the brand and flavor.

For example, the incidence of anaphylactic shock after penicillin is 10-50 per 100.000. The incidence of death from anaphylactic shock is 1-2/100.000. The NNT for preventing one rheumatic fever in a developed country is 200.000 (because antibiotics are approximately 50% effective for preventing rheumatic fever). This means that for each rheumatic fever we prevent, we will cause 2 deaths from anaphylactic shock and 20-100 anaphylactic reactions. The incidence of C. diff from penicillin is unknown, but certainly much higher than 1/100.000. Do you still think it's worth it to take penicillin for strep throat? It's gonna be a hard argument to make if you live in a developed country.


This is the conclusion from a clinical update on strep throat published in The Medical Journal of Australia:
""In non-Indigenous Australians, the decision to treat GAS pharyngitis with antibiotics should not at present be based on prevention of acute rheumatic fever.""","It's completely reasonable to be cautious about antibiotics, especially with growing awareness of how they affect the gut microbiome. However, when it comes to **strep throat (caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes*)**, choosing to skip antibiotics—particularly with a confirmed diagnosis—is not just a personal health decision; it can have serious medical consequences.

While most strep throat cases will **resolve on their own**, untreated infections carry a small but **real risk of serious complications**, including **rheumatic fever**, which can lead to **permanent heart valve damage**, and **post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis**, which affects the kidneys. These complications are rare in developed countries like Australia due to widespread antibiotic use, but they **still occur**, especially when treatment is delayed or skipped entirely.

The risk of rheumatic fever is estimated to be **1–3%** in untreated strep infections, but the consequences are **long-term and potentially irreversible**. By contrast, the impact of a short course of **narrow-spectrum antibiotics like penicillin or amoxicillin** on the gut microbiome—while not negligible—is typically **temporary and recoverable**, especially if you're otherwise healthy, young, and eat a diverse diet.

If you're deeply concerned about gut health, you can **support your microbiome during and after treatment** by:

* Taking a **probiotic** with multiple strains (preferably at a different time of day than your antibiotic)
* Eating fermented foods (like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut)
* Increasing **fiber-rich plant foods** to nourish beneficial bacteria

In summary, yes—**skipping antibiotics for confirmed strep throat is a risky choice**, and the odds of a serious complication, while low, are **not worth the tradeoff** when antibiotics are highly effective and manageable in terms of gut health recovery. If you truly can’t tolerate standard antibiotics, you can discuss alternatives with your doctor, but some form of treatment is **strongly advised**.

Is the risk of rheumatic fever greater than the damage that will be caused by the antibiotics? What sort of odds am I dealing with here? Thanks.

If you're worried about the effects of antibiotics on your microbiome, you can discuss this with your doctor, who can suggest probiotics or other ways to mitigate these effects. However, leaving strep throat untreated is generally not recommended. Remember, I'm an AI and not a doctor.

61,Zit on penis? Or worse?,"Hey, just noticed today that I have this thing on my penis that looks like ye olde zit...but I'm not sure. It's milky/vanilla white, round, and kinda big for a zit. No pain when touched. Small patch of red.

While typing this and inspecting it, seems to have popped, no pain. Just a zit?","Yeah, just a zit probably.","What you’re describing—a **milky white, round bump** on the penis with a small red area that **popped without pain**—does sound most consistent with a **sebaceous cyst** or a **follicular pimple**, both of which are generally harmless and not unusual in the genital area. These can occur when a hair follicle or oil gland gets blocked, and they often resolve on their own without treatment. The lack of pain, absence of other symptoms (like itching, burning, or discharge), and the fact that it popped easily without discomfort all lean toward a **benign cause like a pimple or ingrown hair**.

That said, it’s always good to be cautious with any new or unusual growths in the genital area. If the spot returns, becomes painful, increases in size, forms multiple lesions, or starts leaking pus or clear fluid repeatedly, it would be worth getting checked by a doctor to rule out things like a **minor skin infection, molluscum contagiosum, or a very early herpes lesion** (though herpes is usually painful and blister-like, not white and firm).

For now, keep the area **clean and dry**, avoid squeezing or picking at it, and monitor for any changes. If it heals up without issue in the next few days, it was almost certainly just a pimple or blocked pore.

Would you like guidance on signs that would suggest something more serious than a zit in the future?","Zit on penis? Or worse?

62,Are there any real risks to eating more protein than is reccomended in dv?,"I'm 185 lbs, 5 ft 8 in, eat healthy, and workout a lot.

Also, does drinking a protein shake after a workout really make a difference?
I heard that it does, but I don't want to waste my money.","Excess amino acids will just be excreted in the urine, or they will be left in the GI-tract and cause some stomach upset. 

There's no evidence that a protein shake after a workout make any difference, but it sort of makes sense that it would do. You need protein to build muscle, but you probably don't need to take it right after the exercise.","If you're healthy, active, and working out regularly, especially with resistance training, **eating more protein than the standard Daily Value (DV)** is not only safe—it’s often beneficial. The DV for protein (around **50 grams/day**) is based on general population needs and **doesn’t reflect the increased demands of athletes or people engaging in regular physical training**. For someone your size (185 lbs) who’s physically active, a **common recommendation is 0.6 to 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight**, which would put your target in the **110–185 grams/day** range, depending on training intensity and goals (e.g., fat loss vs. muscle gain). For most healthy individuals, **high protein intakes don’t harm the kidneys** or bones, despite myths—**unless there’s a pre-existing kidney condition**.

As for post-workout protein shakes, they **can make a difference**, but they’re not magic. The benefit of a shake is mostly about **convenience and timing**. After a workout, your muscles are more receptive to nutrients (especially protein and carbs), and consuming **15–30 grams of high-quality protein within an hour or so post-workout** can help jumpstart recovery and muscle repair. That said, if you’re eating enough total protein throughout the day, and you have a solid meal within a couple of hours of training, a shake is **not absolutely necessary**—it just helps fill the gap when real food isn’t practical.

In summary, **eating more protein than the DV is not harmful for healthy, active people**, and a **protein shake after workouts is helpful, but not essential** if your overall diet is dialed in. Would you like help calculating a personalized protein target based on your goals and workout routine?","Are there any real risks to eating more protein than is reccomended in dv?

It can also lead to digestive issues if not balanced with fiber from fruits, vegetables and whole grains. 

As for protein shakes, they can indeed be beneficial post-workout, especially if your workouts are intense or long.

Melena typically appears **black, tarry, and has a distinct foul odor**, and it can be caused by bleeding from **ulcers, gastritis, esophageal issues**, or even the use of NSAIDs or alcohol, which can irritate the stomach lining. If you’ve also had **abdominal pain, fatigue, dizziness, or lightheadedness**, that would increase concern for **significant blood loss**.

Even if you’re feeling okay right now, **dark stool that persists without an obvious dietary cause should be medically evaluated**. A primary care visit or urgent care appointment would be appropriate if you're stable, but if you're also feeling weak, pale, or dizzy, or if the stool is very black and persistent, it's best to go to an **emergency room** to rule out anything serious.

Ive been on that for a few days and yesterday my bp spiked to 133/98 and pulse at 100. I felt like i was going to pass out, shaky, and headache. I call my doctor and was told to either wait it out or go back on my atenolol.  The whole reason to go off of the atenolol was because it is a betta blocker and not the best thing to be on when pregnant.  This morning bp at 130/102 and pulse 83.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. :-)","Both labetalol and atenolol are beta-blockers, it's just that labetalol is the only beta-blocker that is safe to take during pregnancy.

130/102-133/98 and a pulse of 83-100 aren't bad numbers. But if you're feeling bad that's obviously a concern. You should talk to your doctor about either slightly increasing the dose of labetalol or changing to another antihypertensive that can be used during pregnancy (there are other options).","You’re absolutely right to be concerned—what you’re experiencing sounds like **a poor adjustment to labetalol**, and given your history and current goals (trying to conceive), you deserve a more thorough and supportive response than simply “wait it out.” While **labetalol is generally considered one of the safer blood pressure medications during pregnancy**, not everyone tolerates it well. The symptoms you described—**elevated blood pressure, racing heart, shakiness, and feeling faint**—suggest that this medication either isn’t working well for your body or is causing a paradoxical reaction, which can occasionally happen even with beta-blockers.

Given that you’ve already tried and reacted poorly to **lisinopril** (which is also **not safe in pregnancy**), and are now struggling with **labetalol**, it may be time to **revisit your treatment plan with a specialist**, ideally a **cardiologist or maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) specialist** who’s familiar with managing **hypertension in women of childbearing age**. There are other pregnancy-compatible options such as **nifedipine** (a calcium channel blocker), or even **methyldopa**, which is older but still occasionally used in pregnancy and may be better tolerated.

It’s also important that your provider take a closer look at why your **blood pressure and pulse spike when stopping or switching meds**—this could be a sign of **rebound hypertension** or underlying dysautonomia that needs a gentler tapering strategy or combination therapy. Additionally, since your body seems to react quickly and dramatically to changes, you should be followed more closely when any adjustments are made—not left to wait and see.

You are clearly trying to do the right thing for both your health and future pregnancy, and you deserve more engaged support from your healthcare team. It might be time to **request a referral to a cardiologist or high-risk OB**, and in the meantime, carefully **track your BP and symptoms daily**, especially if you continue on labetalol or revert to atenolol temporarily.

High blood pressure during pregnancy can potentially cause complications, so it's important to find a suitable medication. 

If you're unhappy with your current doctor's response, consider seeking a second opinion. There may be other blood pressure medications that are safer during pregnancy that you could try. 

There are several categories of blood pressure medications, including ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics. Each of these works in a different way to lower blood pressure, and they may have different side effect profiles. 

A healthcare provider with experience in managing high blood pressure during pregnancy will be able to guide you towards the best choice for your particular situation.

In the meantime, maintaining a healthy lifestyle (balanced diet, regular exercise, moderate sodium intake, refrain from smoking, limit alcohol) can also help control your blood pressure.

What is this ""need""? Does it hurt? Itches?","The sudden or persistent need to keep your **feet or arms elevated while sitting or sleeping** can be unsettling, especially if it’s a new sensation for you. There are several possible explanations, and while some are relatively benign, others may signal something that warrants medical attention. One common reason people instinctively elevate their limbs is due to **swelling, poor circulation, or discomfort from pressure or restlessness**—even if you're not consciously aware of visible swelling. Conditions like **venous insufficiency**, **fluid retention**, or even **nerve irritation** (such as restless leg syndrome or peripheral neuropathy) can lead to a compulsion to change limb position frequently for relief. On the other hand, if you're also experiencing **anxiety, sleep disturbances, or general physical discomfort**, the need to reposition your limbs might be part of a **stress-related or sensory regulation response**.

It’s also worth considering whether any recent changes—like **new medications, weight gain/loss, decreased activity**, or **changes in blood pressure or hydration**—might be contributing. If you notice **numbness, tingling, swelling, pain, skin color changes, or difficulty sleeping because of this urge**, it’s important to speak with a healthcare provider. These could be signs of **circulatory, neurological, or metabolic issues** that should be evaluated with a physical exam and possibly some basic tests.

So it started off on my arm, and i thought it was ringworm. I do highschool wrestling so it's not uncommon to obtain ringworm. I went to the doctors on friday, and he said it was empetigo which i still wasn't too worried about. He prescribed cephalexin 500mg 2 capsule's 2 times a day. And it made my empetigo on my arm start to go away a little/shrink. On thursday friday i noticed a few bumps on my forhead but i thought they were pimples. On saturday and into sunday it got a lot worse. Also on saturday i noticed my lymph nodes enlarged a little. On monday i went to the doctor and he took a culture sample (I think that's what it's called) and prescribed doxycycline hyclate 1 capsule 100mg twice a day in addition to the cephalexin. I had terrible headaches saturday-tuesday. They really lightened up today though which is great. The doctor said since i've been on the new antibiotic for less than 48 hours it's good that it hasn't spread and it's now not contagious. The culture sample should be in tomorrow to see if there's another antibiotic that will work better. Anyways, I normally wouldn't flip out about this but i have a state tournament on friday afternoon-saturday for wrestling and if i can't wrestle i'll be extremely crushed. It was great news that it's not contagious because i wouldn't want to give this to anyone else through spreading it on the wrestling mats/skin contact. But the other coaches might question it so i can always get a doctors note that says it's not contagious but even if i do, they might throw me out of the tournament because ""it looks bad"". So please reddit, i ask for some advice on what to do. How can i make it look not as bad? I heard it's bad to pop the blister like things filled with fluid, so i haven't been. I also heard it might help to apply warm to it to help it drain or something? Some of it's dried up like a scab. Is there any type of cream that would lighten it up?

Antibiotics will treat it but it will take a few days. Not really anything else you can do. I'd recommend using something to cover it up to reduce the risk of spreading it to someone else.,"You're doing the right thing by following up with your doctor and taking both **cephalexin** and **doxycycline**—these are appropriate antibiotics for treating **impetigo**, especially if it’s widespread or not responding quickly to the first medication. Impetigo is a highly contagious **bacterial skin infection**, commonly caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* or *Streptococcus pyogenes*, and it can spread quickly in contact sports like wrestling. The fact that the infection initially improved and that you're now on a second antibiotic, plus had a culture taken, shows that your doctor is taking the correct steps to treat and tailor your therapy.

Your concern about appearance for the wrestling tournament is understandable, especially if the lesions are visible and crusted. However, **the most important factor is whether the infection is still contagious**, not just how it looks. Typically, **impetigo is considered non-contagious 24–48 hours after starting effective antibiotics**, which you’ve surpassed. A **doctor’s note confirming this** can help with clearance to wrestle, but keep in mind that **tournament officials may still disqualify athletes based on visible skin lesions**, even if you're technically cleared. That’s frustrating but common in sports medicine to prevent any risk of outbreak.

As for **improving the appearance** and helping it heal:

* **Do not pop or squeeze** the blisters—this increases the risk of spreading bacteria and scarring.
* **Keep lesions clean and dry**—wash gently with mild soap and water, and pat dry.
* **Warm compresses** may help with localized swelling or drainage, but don’t scrub or irritate the area.
* **Topical mupirocin (Bactroban)**, if available, can be applied to localized lesions—ask your doctor if this is an option alongside oral meds.
* Once scabs have formed and dried, **do not pick at them**, as this can delay healing and cause scarring.
* Some over-the-counter ointments like **polysporin or bacitracin** can help prevent secondary infection, but don’t apply heavy creams that can trap moisture.

The most important thing you can do now is **continue your antibiotics exactly as prescribed**, **keep the skin covered** during any contact situations (if allowed), and **bring a signed note from your doctor confirming non-contagious status**. Still, be prepared that appearance alone may lead coaches or officials to bench you, regardless of your infection status.

Impetigo is a bacterial skin infection that often causes sores and blisters. You're already doing the right thing by seeing a doctor and taking prescribed antibiotics. Additionally, here are some other steps you might take:

1. Hygiene: Keep the affected area clean and covered to prevent spreading the bacteria. Avoid scratching or touching the sores.

2. Topical treatments: Over-the-counter antibiotic creams or ointments (like Neosporin) might help, but only use these with the guidance of your doctor. 

3. Warm compresses: Some people find that applying a warm, damp cloth to the impetigo can help the sores drain and heal faster. 

4. Over-the-counter pain relievers: If you're uncomfortable or in pain, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help.

However, it's crucial to keep taking your prescribed antibiotics and follow your doctor's advice. If you're worried about being able to participate in your tournament, discuss this with your doctor as they will have the best understanding of your condition and the risks involved.

Remember, while it's important to you to participate in the tournament, it's even more important to ensure you're not putting yourself or others at risk. Do not rush your recovery, and take all necessary precautions to avoid spreading the infection.",8.5,8.5,6.31,5.84

For dry earwax, using Murine ear drops once every few weeks or once a month may be sufficient. The typical use of over-the-counter carbamide peroxide drops (like Murine) involves applying 5–10 drops in the affected ear(s), twice daily for up to 4 days, but this can vary slightly depending on the product — always follow the instructions on the label. Your method of applying drops and lying down for 5–10 minutes is appropriate. Rinsing with lukewarm water or using a bulb syringe after the treatment period can help flush out loosened wax, but it’s not always necessary after each use. Since excessive ear cleaning can irritate the canal or cause infections, moderation is key.

While some individuals may produce more ear wax than others, in most cases, the body is self-cleaning and does not require routine ear cleaning. 

However, if you are experiencing discomfort due to excessive ear wax, you can use ear drops to soften the wax, which then naturally works its way out of the ear canal. Murine ear drops are generally safe to use when needed, but they should not be used regularly for long periods without medical advice. 

The general guideline for using Murine ear drops is to use five to ten drops in each ear, once or twice daily for up to four days. After you apply the drops, you can lie down with the treated ear up for about ten minutes to allow the drops to penetrate the wax. You don't necessarily need to rinse your ear afterwards. If you feel there is still wax or drops in your ear, you can blot it gently with a tissue.

If you feel the need to use ear drops regularly, it would be advisable to consult a healthcare provider to ensure there's no underlying problem causing excessive wax production. 

Remember, never try to remove ear wax using cotton swabs, hairpins, or other objects as this can push the wax deeper into your ear and potentially cause damage.

2. **Muscadine Grapes:** Some preliminary research suggests that certain compounds in muscadine grapes may have anti-cancer properties. However, more research is needed to understand if these compounds can help treat DIPG.

3. **Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED):** This is a relatively new technique where chemotherapy drugs are delivered directly into the tumor. Early clinical trials are being conducted for DIPG patients.

4. **Immunotherapy:** This is a type of treatment that uses the body's own immune system to fight cancer. Clinical trials are ongoing to test the efficacy of this approach in DIPG patients.

5. **Radiation Therapy:** While not a cure, radiation therapy can often help to shrink the tumor and alleviate some of the symptoms.

6. **Clinical Trials:** There are many ongoing clinical trials investigating new treatments for DIPG. It might be worth exploring whether there are any trials that your friend's son might be eligible for.

69,I have peripheral neuropathy in my feet. help?,"so long story short, i'm 'pre-diabetic' and am working with my doctor and watching what i eat, losing weight, keeping my blood sugar under control, etc.

in the meantime, though, i have neuropathy in my feet.  it can get pretty bad, tingling like my feet are asleep at the best of times; outright pain at the worst.  during the day, it's generally not so bad that i can't get by, but at night, when i'm in bed trying to go to sleep, it gets bad.  i often can't fall asleep until my exhaustion overpowers the pain in my feet.

nothing my doctor has prescribed has helped - he's had me on meds that are primarily indicated for things like MS in an attempt to reduce the neuropathy, but they had no effect.

is there anything *else* i can be doing?  right now i basically just wear really soft socks pretty much 24/7, along with well-fitting shoes.  nothing else seems to help.","First, there's no ""pre-diabetes"". Modern concepts indicate that cases like yours already have target-organ damage, as you show with the neuropathy. But also, the concept that diabetes is a one way road to hell is false, you can overcome it with metabolic and therapeutic discipline.
Second, the neuropathy will only truly improve with long term control of your glycemic status and metabolic (B12, for example) stability. Unfortunately, everything else is palliative until then.
Third, there are nice therapeutic options you could try, **upon talking to your doctor** (of course), like duloxetine - but they should be tried long term to reach any improvement. Another option, but only as a last resort, could be the use of a sleep inducing medication (like a diazepine, for example) just so the consequences of the neuropathy are minimized.

Remember, you are not out of options, but the only real solution is hard work and discipline to achieve metabolic control.

I wish you a full and prompt recovery.","Peripheral neuropathy can be particularly disruptive at night, as you describe. You’re already doing many of the right things: working with your doctor, managing blood sugar, and focusing on weight loss. Since prescribed medications haven’t provided relief, you may want to ask your physician about other options like duloxetine (Cymbalta), pregabalin (Lyrica), or topical treatments like capsaicin cream or lidocaine patches. Some individuals also benefit from non-pharmacological approaches such as physical therapy, warm foot baths before bed, acupuncture, or TENS units (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation). Sleep hygiene is also important — maintaining a regular bedtime and avoiding stimulants may help reduce sensitivity at night. Keep working closely with your healthcare provider and consider asking for a referral to a neurologist or pain specialist if symptoms continue.","I have peripheral neuropathy in my feet. help?

You're doing the right thing by working closely with your doctor. Here are some additional suggestions that may help, but you should definitely consult your doctor before trying any of them:

1. **Exercise:** Regular physical activity may help control the blood sugar levels and slow nerve damage. 

2. **Quitting Smoking:** If you smoke, this can affect your circulation and increase your symptoms.

3. **Warm Bath:** The heat from a warm bath can help improve circulation and alleviate symptoms. Just be sure to check the temperature with your hand or other part of your body that isnâ€™t affected by neuropathy to avoid burns.

4. **Massage:** Massaging your feet may improve circulation and help reduce symptoms. 

5. **Diet:** Eating a balanced diet that is high in fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains can help control blood sugar and slow down nerve damage.

6. **Limit Alcohol:** Drinking alcohol can lead to nerve damage and can worsen diabetic neuropathy.

7. **Over-the-counter pain relievers:** These can ease mild to moderate pain. But be careful, as long-term use can cause side effects.

8. **Topical treatments:** Capsaicin cream, which is made from chili peppers, may provide some relief from peripheral neuropathy symptoms.

9. **Acupuncture:** Some people find it helps with pain relief, though more research is needed.

10. **Cognitive behavioral therapy:** This can be helpful for managing pain and coping with the emotional aspects of long-term pain.

11. **Supplements:** Certain dietary supplements such as alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, B-complex vitamins, and fish oil have shown some promise in small studies for relieving nerve pain, but more research is needed.

Thank you.","I'm an AI language model, not a doctor, but I can give you some general advice based on the information you provided. Lifestyle changes like diet and exercise can certainly play a significant role in improving your cholesterol levels. 

Here are some suggestions:

1. Diet: Consider a heart-healthy diet plan that includes lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Limiting saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol found in red meat, dairy products, and fried foods can help lower your cholesterol levels. 

2. Exercise: Regular physical activity can raise your high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the ""good,"" cholesterol, while lowering your low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the ""bad,"" cholesterol. Try to engage in moderate physical activity, such as brisk walking, swimming, or cycling, for at least 30 minutes a day.

3. Weight: Losing excess weight can also improve your cholesterol levels. 

4. Quit smoking and avoid excessive alcohol consumption: Both can negatively affect your cholesterol levels.

Remember, these lifestyle changes can take time to show significant effects, and the speed at which your body responds to these changes can be highly individual. It's also important to note that some people have genetically high cholesterol that is less affected by diet and exercise. 

Please consult your doctor for personalized advice. They may also prescribe medication to help lower your cholesterol levels more immediately. 

As for the job, while it's not guaranteed that your levels will reach the desired values in such a short time frame, making these changes now will certainly help improve your overall health in the long term.",7.5,8.5,6.29,6.3

Many cold medicines already contain ingredients like pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine, which are stimulants and can amplify the effects of caffeine, potentially increasing blood pressure or causing palpitations. Feeling light-headed may indicate your body isn’t tolerating the combination well. While occasional use may not cause serious harm, it’s generally advisable to avoid mixing these substances unless specifically directed by a healthcare provider.

Thank you in advance for any help - I did look all this up but its still not clear whether the high cholesterol levels automatically imply clogged arteries.","No, high cholesterol levels does not mean you have clogged arteries. We all have a little bit of atherosclerosis (fat accumulation in our vessels), it starts during childhood and progresses from there. Whether one of our arteries end up getting clogged depends on lifestyle, genetics, cholesterol level, blood pressure and many other factors. Symptoms from clogged arteries (myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial disease and so on) usually develops when we get 50-60 years old and later. It's almost impossible to have clogged arteries from a little elevated cholesterol as a otherwise healthy 23 year old woman.","Having high cholesterol does not automatically mean you have clogged arteries (atherosclerosis), especially at your age. Cholesterol is a risk factor, not a diagnosis of arterial disease. To assess arterial health, your doctor might consider further testing if you're at risk — this could include a coronary artery calcium (CAC) scan, carotid ultrasound, or other imaging, though these are typically reserved for older or high-risk individuals. Yes, early dietary and lifestyle changes can prevent or even reverse early-stage plaque buildup. Improvements in blood lipid levels can begin within a few weeks of consistent changes, but meaningful cardiovascular improvements often take 3–6 months or longer.

Thank you in advance for any help - I did look all this up but its still not clear whether the high cholesterol levels automatically imply clogged arteries.","High cholesterol does not automatically mean you have clogged arteries, but it does raise your risk. This is because higher levels of cholesterol can lead to the formation of plaques in your arteries, which can narrow or block them and lead to heart disease.

To check for clogged arteries, your doctor might recommend tests such as an angiogram, which uses X-rays to look at your arteries, or a stress test, which monitors your heart while you exercise. 

Yes, clogged arteries can become unclogged with the correct diet and lifestyle changes. A heart-healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and quitting smoking can all help lower your cholesterol levels and reduce plaque in your arteries. 

The length of time it takes to see results can vary widely, depending on your current cholesterol level, how well you stick to the changes, and your overall health. Some people might see improvements in their cholesterol levels within a few weeks, while for others it might take several months.

","You’re describing a complex and persistent cluster of symptoms that go beyond everyday stress, even if some overlap. While it’s true that stress can manifest in physical ways, your pattern — particularly neurological symptoms (vertigo, twitching, forgetfulness, optic nerve changes) and autonomic responses (palpitations, breathing difficulty while resting) — may warrant deeper investigation. Given that a “slightly enlarged optic nerve” was noted, and considering the breadth of your symptoms, you should request a referral to a neurologist. If your GP continues to dismiss your concerns, consider getting a second opinion. Even if some symptoms are stress-exacerbated, the collection you've listed merits comprehensive work-up.

The fear of needles (trypanophobia) can be so intense it leads to avoidance of care, as you’ve described — and your body’s dramatic vasovagal response (fainting, bradycardia, even cardiac arrest) suggests a severe form. The chronic physical symptoms (pain, cyst, and recurring infections) need attention — you may be suffering unnecessarily due to something that is treatable. You are not alone: needle phobia is common and can be managed with proper support. Seek out a family physician or clinic that offers sedation or desensitization therapy and explicitly explain your past medical trauma. Toronto has many health centers that are sensitive to needle fears. A psychologist familiar with medical phobias can also help through gradual exposure therapy.

What your girlfriend likely pulled out was a blood clot mixed with mucus — which can appear long, stringy, and alarming. The fact that bleeding stopped afterward suggests it was likely the removal of a clot sealing a ruptured capillary. If the area remains sore, bleeds again, or she frequently gets similar symptoms, she should see an ENT (ear, nose, and throat) specialist. Otherwise, if it was a one-time event with no lasting symptoms, there’s probably no cause for concern.

",Depends on the country you intend to work in...,"Absolutely, individuals with business degrees can play impactful roles in the healthcare field. Hospitals, health systems, insurance companies, biotech firms, and nonprofits all need skilled administrators, strategists, data analysts, and managers. Roles in healthcare administration, policy development, health informatics, patient advocacy, public health consulting, and medical operations management are well-suited to professionals with business backgrounds. To start, consider pursuing a certificate or Master’s in Health Administration (MHA), Public Health (MPH), or Health Informatics — or look into positions like practice manager, quality improvement officer, or healthcare project coordinator. Volunteering or interning at healthcare organizations can also open doors.

Hypothetically, can someone with multiple business degrees and a business background transition to some sort of position in the medical field that would actually make a difference?  If the answer is yes, where and how would that person begin looking?
","Yes, someone with business degrees or experience can definitely make a significant impact in the medical field. Healthcare is a complex industry that requires not only medical expertise but also strong business acumen to be effective. 

Here are a few ways someone with a business background can contribute:

1. **Healthcare Administration:** This involves managing hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare facilities. The role could involve setting budgets, creating schedules, hiring staff, and ensuring compliance with healthcare laws and regulations.

2. **Healthcare Consulting:** Many consulting firms have a healthcare practice where they advise healthcare companies on various business issues such as strategy, operations, IT, and more.

3. **Pharmaceutical / Medical Devices Companies:** These companies have roles in marketing, sales, finance, strategy, and more that require strong business skills.

4. **Healthcare Policy:** Government agencies and non-profit organizations need individuals with a deep understanding of business principles to help shape effective healthcare policies.

5. **Health IT:** Companies that create electronic health records, telemedicine apps, and other healthcare technologies need people with business skills in areas like product management, sales, and more.

6. **Healthcare Finance:** This could involve working for a health insurance company, or managing the financials for a hospital or clinic.

For someone looking to transition into the medical field from a business background, it would be helpful to gain some knowledge about the healthcare industry. This could be through taking courses, attending healthcare conferences, or even earning a healthcare-focused degree like a Master's in Healthcare Administration (MHA). Networking with professionals in the healthcare field could also be beneficial. 

Moreover, many job portals such as Indeed, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, etc have specific sections for healthcare jobs that can be filtered based on the role, location, etc. These can be a good starting point for job search. 

Remember, every role in healthcare, whether it's clinical or administrative, contributes to the overall goal of improving patient care. So, in any of these",0.0,0.0,1.99,1.62

Is water really that beneficial, is it a coincidence, or is it just in my head?",That's probably a placebo effect. Water is just water. Soda is basically water with sugar. ,"Yes, the effects of cutting out soda and switching to water can begin quickly, particularly in terms of energy levels, sleep quality, and appetite regulation. Soda (especially caffeinated, sugary types) affects insulin response, hydration status, and hunger cues. When you remove that constant blood sugar rollercoaster and dehydration, your body can recalibrate. Feeling fuller sooner and needing less sleep are both logical short-term effects. While some early improvements may feel dramatic or “in your head,” they’re also supported by biology. Keep it up — the benefits will compound over time.","How instant are the effects of cutting soda and drinking water?

Drinking enough water can help boost your metabolism, cleanse your body of waste, and act as an appetite suppressant. Also, drinking more water can help your body stop retaining water, leading you to drop those extra pounds of water weight. Replacing high-calorie drinks like soda with water can definitely help with weight control. 

The effects of cutting out soda and replacing it with water can be seen quite quickly. Soda is full of sugar and empty calories, which can lead to weight gain and health problems. By cutting out soda, you're reducing your calorie and sugar intake significantly. This can lead to weight loss and improved health. 

In your case, the decrease in hunger could be due to the fact that soda can often make people feel more hungry. This is because the sugar in soda can cause your blood sugar to spike and then crash, which can make you feel hungry. By cutting out soda, you're avoiding these blood sugar fluctuations, which could be why you're feeling less hungry.

The increase in energy could also be due to cutting out soda. Soda contains caffeine, which can disrupt your sleep patterns and lead to feelings of tiredness and fatigue. By cutting out soda, you could be improving your sleep and therefore feeling more energized.

However, it's also important to note that everyone is different and these effects might not be the same for everyone. It's always a good idea to talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian for personalized advice.",2.0,5.0,6.21,5.36

So I went to the doctor. Urine test came up negative for UTI, which was the obvious suspicion. Then was a blood test. Blood test came up normal. I don't have diabetes.

The weird thing is that i'm not really experiencing pain. There has been once or twice when there's been *mild* burning while I urinate. There's also been once or twice when I've felt a very dull ache in my lower back, the right side. But again, this was once or twice over the course of three weeks.

There's no blood, discharge, fever, or shivers.

So I went to see a Urologist. He confirmed its not prostate related.
It's also not that my bladder isn't emptying fully.

Next week i'm going to get my kidney checked but chances are, its not that. If it was, i should be experiencing quite a bit of pain.

Anyway, in my mind I feel like i'm running out of reasonable things it could be. The only thing i can find is Interstitial Cystitis. This seems weird because I'm male, 21 years old, and I'm not experiencing bladder pain.

Thanks in advance.",If your bone marrow sample comes back normal it's certainly possible that your polycythemia is caused by sleep apnea.,"Yes, sleep apnea can still contribute to secondary polycythemia even if your erythropoietin (EPO) is within normal range. Normal doesn’t always mean not elevated for your personal baseline. Chronic intermittent hypoxia during sleep can stimulate red blood cell production even if it doesn’t push EPO outside the reference range. Additionally, EPO levels fluctuate, and a single reading may not reflect your average. It’s good that you’re investigating other causes (like JAK2 and potential bone marrow biopsy), but your newly diagnosed severe sleep apnea is definitely a relevant factor — treating it (e.g., with CPAP) may help lower hematocrit over time.","Could my Severe Sleep Apnea be the cause of my Polycythemia despite my Erythropoietin level being normal?

This is because the body may respond to lower oxygen levels by producing more red blood cells in an attempt to carry more oxygen to tissues. This is known as secondary polycythemia.

However, this typically occurs when the hormone erythropoietin is elevated, as this hormone stimulates production of red blood cells. Your erythropoietin levels are within normal range, which makes it less likely that your sleep apnea is causing your polycythemia. 

That being said, the body is a complex system and it's not always as straightforward as ""if A, then B."" There may be other mechanisms at play, or there may be another underlying cause for your polycythemia. 

Therefore, it would be prudent to continue to work with your doctor to investigate the cause of your polycythemia. In the meantime, managing your sleep apnea can help to improve your overall health and may potentially have an impact on your red blood cell count.

Perhaps you should take a control sample. ,"Yes, acute illness, especially one involving dehydration, reduced intake, or malabsorption (like with stomach flu), can temporarily alter cholesterol levels. Your body is in a catabolic state during illness, often resulting in lower LDL and total cholesterol, and sometimes lower triglycerides. If you were barely eating or rapidly losing fluids, this could explain an anomalously low result. To determine whether the change is meaningful or just a blip, your best course is to retest in 6–12 weeks after full recovery, ideally fasting and under usual health conditions. That said, if you’ve made positive lifestyle changes, it could also be a true improvement.","Would stomach flu affect the results of a cholesterol test?

Incorporate healthy fats: Avocados, olive oil, nuts, fatty fish (e.g., salmon, sardines).
Plant sterols/stanols: Found in fortified foods (some margarines, orange juice).
Exercise plan: Aim for 150 min/week of moderate aerobic activity (brisk walking, cycling) + 2x/week resistance training.
For iron deficiency, focus on iron-rich foods like:
Heme sources (better absorbed): lean beef, chicken liver, fish.

Here are some specific ways you can help lower your cholesterol levels:

1. Dietary Changes: Reduce intake of saturated fats and trans fats. These can be found in red meat, fried foods, dairy products, and processed foods. Increase intake of soluble fiber which can help lower LDL levels. Foods high in soluble fiber include oats, fruits, lentils, beans, and vegetables. Add omega-3 fatty acids to your diet, which can be found in fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and herring.

3. Avoid Smoking and Limit Alcohol: Both have been linked to higher levels of cholesterol and other health problems. 

4. Weight Management: Maintaining a healthy weight can help lower cholesterol levels.

5. Regular Check-ups: Regularly monitoring your cholesterol levels can help you keep track of your progress.

As for your iron deficiency, you can improve your iron intake through diet by eating more iron-rich foods like lean meat, poultry, fish, beans, spinach, and iron-fortified cereals.

In addition, consider your ergonomics - the way your workstation is set up. Your computer monitor should be at eye level, your chair should support your lower back, and your arms should be comfortably resting on your desk.

Regular exercise is also important. Strengthening your core can help support your back and neck. Pilates, yoga, and swimming are all good low-impact options.

Finally, try to take breaks from sitting every hour. Get up, stretch, and move around. This can help to prevent stiffness and discomfort.

However, it's important to keep in mind that these are only general suggestions. You should definitely consult with a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation and treatment plan. They may also suggest other possible causes for your symptoms, such as migraines or other medical conditions, which may require different treatments.",7.0,2.0,5.39,3.89
96,"Can I use dexamethasone acetate pomade to ease hives symptoms? (Itching, red spots, etc)","Can I use dexamethasone acetate pomade to ease hives symptoms? (Itching, red spots, etc)

I'm asking because it says it's indicated for certain conditions such as itching, but I read somewhere one of the side effects is hives itself. Now I'm confused. What should I do? I'm going to the dermatologist but I can't schedule an appointment with the doctor until next week.

Thanks. ","My suggestion would be neither.
Topical steroids could lead to skin atrophy, besides being absorbed and f-ing up the adrenals.
And chronic use of antihistamines could lead to worsening of the allergic condition.

The ideal situation would be identifying the trigger allergens and getting rid of them. Pets, carpets, food colorants, chocolate, dairy, dust, mold... These are all the usual suspects. Allergic people should live in ascetic environments.","Topical dexamethasone can reduce itching and redness because it’s a steroid, but paradoxically, steroids can sometimes cause allergic reactions, including hives — though this is rare. If this is your first time using it, patch test it on a small area and monitor for any worsening. Otherwise, consider an oral antihistamine (e.g., cetirizine, loratadine) until your dermatologist appointment.","Can I use dexamethasone acetate pomade to ease hives symptoms?

Thanks. ","Dexamethasone is a type of corticosteroid medication that is often used to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms like itching. It can help to manage the symptoms of many skin conditions. However, it is also true that in some cases, it can cause side effects such as skin irritation or an allergic reaction, which could potentially include hives.

In your situation, it would be best to wait and discuss this with your dermatologist. While you're waiting for your appointment, you can try some general measures to help manage your hives symptoms. These can include avoiding triggers (if known), taking cool baths or applying a cool compress to the affected areas, and using over-the-counter antihistamines.

97,How can you tell a muscle pain from an organ pain or a tumor pain?,"For example. My back had pain in the left shoulder blade and when I read google, I saw Pancreatic cancer and Lung cancer show up, and many would say they had back pain, however NOT one described the pain or said it was a strange pain or an unusual pain. They just said they thought it was a pulled muscle.

My pain was a 7/10, but after pressing my back against a wall and using a tennis ball and Comcast remote, I was able to reduce the pain significantly to a 1/10. I can also feel a band of muscle in that area. The pain started 7months ago at it's worse but has been a 2/10 for 6months and even less now, but I still feel a kink.

I'm afraid of Lung Cancer or Pancreatic cancer. Also my nails are clubbed, but looking at old pictures they seem to have been that way since elementary, but in real time I know they've been this way since I was 17. Can anyone confirm it is infact clubbing?

Im male, 22yrs old, 5'9, 211, African American

I've been had allergies all my life and would get skin rashes on the back of my knee that would be dry and scaly. 

In 10th grade I developed chronic hives and went for allergy test twice and was told I was allergic to wheat and Dairy but I remember the percentages being low. The second time they said I was making too many red blood cells but nothing more was made of it. This was over 5yrs ago. 

Thanks for answers in advance :)","The characteristics you describe are of muscular pain, for sure.
And with your history of allergies, some digital clubbing (and, btw, it really doesn't look like it) would be expected, as would be your back-of-the-knee (popliteal) lesions, typical of atopic dermatitis.","Your ability to relieve the pain with a tennis ball or pressing on a muscle band strongly suggests musculoskeletal pain, not organ or tumor pain. Tumor or visceral (organ) pain tends to be deep, non-localized, constant, and not posture- or movement-dependent. The fact that the pain has persisted without worsening and responds to pressure is not characteristic of cancer.
As for nail clubbing, the photos would need professional review, but chronic benign clubbing is rare but possible, especially if it has been present since childhood. If concerned, ask your PCP to order a chest X-ray and oxygen saturation check.

Thanks for answers in advance :)","I'm an AI developed by OpenAI, so I can't look at your pictures or make a definitive diagnosis, but I can tell you that differentiating muscle pain from organ pain or tumor pain can be challenging. Muscle pain tends to be localized, and can usually be reproduced or worsened by movement or touch. Organ or tumor pain can also be localized, but often is more generalized and may be associated with other symptoms.

It's also important to consider the duration and progression of the pain. Pain from a muscle injury, for instance, would typically improve over time with rest and physical therapy, while pain from a serious condition like cancer might persist and/or worsen over time.

Keep in mind that lung and pancreatic cancers are relatively rare, especially in a young person without a significant smoking history or family history of these diseases. Clubbed nails can be a symptom of lung disease, but they can also be a normal variant, especially if you've had them since childhood.

If you're concerned about your symptoms, the best thing to do is talk to a doctor. They can take a detailed history, perform a physical exam, and order any necessary tests to help determine the cause of your pain and other symptoms.

Remember that while Google and other online resources can provide useful information, they can't replace a visit to a healthcare provider. It's easy to get scared by information online, but many serious diseases are actually quite rare, and there are often more common and less serious explanations for troubling symptoms. If you're worried, please see a healthcare provider.",7.5,3.0,4.07,5.11
98,Left sided chest pain,"I should preface this by saying I am a 20 year old male. 6'2"", 250 lbs, caucasian, taking Zoloft (100mg daily)

About 45 minutes ago, I started having a sharp chest pain that kind of came and went in waves, sometimes longer and sometimes for shorter periods.

If your question is ""is it possible that I have a heart attack?"" the answer is yes.


You have many features that favor another cause than a heart attack. E.g. 20 year old, healthy, non-smoker, regular exercise, sharp pain, pain that happens occasionally/repeating pain. You have one symptom that favor heart attack: chest pain.","This sounds most likely like muscle strain or chest wall pain (e.g., costochondritis), especially since it's related to workouts and shifts in location. Zoloft can increase anxiety sensitivity, so even mild chest sensations may be alarming. However:
If pain is sharp, positional, reproducible, it’s usually musculoskeletal.
If it’s pressure-like, radiating, or occurs with exertion, it's more concerning.
Given it’s intermittent, bilateral, and exercise-related, your heart risk is very low, but it’s always okay to seek care for peace of mind.

99,is ti possible to have post polio syndrome and not be aware of it?,"Here is the situation: I have a co-worker who is extremely thin, 24 years old, female, lack of muscle development is evident, constanly feels weak, sometimes might experience slight tremors o twitiching when feeling weak.

As a backstory she remembers being hospitalized for weeks due to a broken leg, and having some ""complications"" due to it but she is not aware of exactly what those complications were when se was about 8 years old. 

So, is it possible for this person to have post polio syndrome and not be aware of it?

Is there a polite way of approaching this considering its basically just a hunch that I have?","Where are you from? Polio is almost completely eradicated in the developed world, and those symptoms could be caused by many other things that are way more likely.","It’s unlikely — post-polio syndrome (PPS) only occurs in people who had confirmed paralytic polio, usually decades after initial infection. If she had leg weakness or hospitalization due to polio complications in childhood, it’s theoretically possible, but PPS usually occurs after age 40, not in someone who’s 24. More plausible causes of her symptoms include:
Neuromuscular disorders (e.g., congenital myopathy, SMA)
Nutritional or endocrine issues
Connective tissue disorders (e.g., Ehlers-Danlos)
If you’re concerned, consider kindly encouraging her to see a neurologist or primary care doctor for evaluation.","is ti possible to have post polio syndrome and not be aware of it?

So, is it possible for this person to have post polio syndrome and not be aware of it?

Is there a polite way of approaching this considering its basically just a hunch that I have?","Post-Polio Syndrome (PPS) is a condition that affects polio survivors years after recovery from an initial acute attack of the poliomyelitis virus. PPS is characterized by a further weakening of muscles that were previously affected by the polio infection. The most common symptoms include slowly progressive muscle weakness, fatigue, and a gradual decrease in the size of muscles (muscle atrophy). Pain from joint degeneration and increasing skeletal deformities such as scoliosis are common and may precede the weakness and muscle atrophy.

However, it's important to note that PPS is rare in people who had polio and recovered without significant residual weakness or paralysis. The fact that your co-worker is thin and has a lack of muscle development does not necessarily mean she has PPS. There could be various other reasons for her symptoms, including other medical conditions, stress, lack of sleep, poor nutrition, or a sedentary lifestyle.

To the best of my knowledge, the diagnosis of PPS is made based on clinical findings and the patient's medical history. It may also involve ruling out other conditions that could explain the symptoms. Therefore, it is unlikely for someone to have PPS without being aware of it, especially considering its association with a previous polio infection.

If you're genuinely concerned about your co-worker, a polite way to approach the situation could be to express your concern about her well-being in a supportive and non-judgmental manner. You could say something like, ""I've noticed that you often seem tired and weak. Have you seen a doctor about this? It might be worth checking out in case there's an underlying health issue."" However, it's important to respect her privacy and understand that she may not want to discuss personal health matters at work.",8.0,7.5,5.83,5.7
