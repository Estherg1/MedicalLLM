symptoms,What are the symptoms of Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM) ?,"LCMV is most commonly recognized as causing neurological disease, as its name implies, though infection without symptoms or mild febrile illnesses are more common clinical manifestations. 
                
For infected persons who do become ill, onset of symptoms usually occurs 8-13 days after exposure to the virus as part of a biphasic febrile illness. This initial phase, which may last as long as a week, typically begins with any or all of the following symptoms: fever, malaise, lack of appetite, muscle aches, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms appearing less frequently include sore throat, cough, joint pain, chest pain, testicular pain, and parotid (salivary gland) pain. 
                
Following a few days of recovery, a second phase of illness may occur. Symptoms may consist of meningitis (fever, headache, stiff neck, etc.), encephalitis (drowsiness, confusion, sensory disturbances, and/or motor abnormalities, such as paralysis), or meningoencephalitis (inflammation of both the brain and meninges). LCMV has also been known to cause acute hydrocephalus (increased fluid on the brain), which often requires surgical shunting to relieve increased intracranial pressure. In rare instances, infection results in myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord) and presents with symptoms such as muscle weakness, paralysis, or changes in body sensation. An association between LCMV infection and myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscles) has been suggested. 
                
Previous observations show that most patients who develop aseptic meningitis or encephalitis due to LCMV survive. No chronic infection has been described in humans, and after the acute phase of illness, the virus is cleared from the body. However, as in all infections of the central nervous system, particularly encephalitis, temporary or permanent neurological damage is possible. Nerve deafness and arthritis have been reported. 
                
Women who become infected with LCMV during pregnancy may pass the infection on to the fetus. Infections occurring during the first trimester may result in fetal death and pregnancy termination, while in the second and third trimesters, birth defects can develop. Infants infected In utero can have many serious and permanent birth defects, including vision problems, mental retardation, and hydrocephaly (water on the brain). Pregnant women may recall a flu-like illness during pregnancy, or may not recall any illness. 
                
LCM is usually not fatal. In general, mortality is less than 1%.","Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) is a viral infection caused by the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which is primarily transmitted to humans through exposure to infected rodents, especially common house mice. The illness typically presents in two phases. The first phase often begins one to two weeks after exposure and includes symptoms that resemble a flu-like illness, such as fever, lack of appetite, malaise, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, chest pain, and sometimes pain in the testicles or salivary glands. This initial stage may resolve temporarily before progressing to a second phase characterized by neurological symptoms. In this phase, individuals may experience fever recurrence, stiff neck, headache, confusion, drowsiness, sensitivity to light (photophobia), and in some cases, motor abnormalities or seizures.

Severe cases can result in complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, or myelitis, which involve inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, the brain itself, and the spinal cord, respectively. Although LCM is not typically fatal, it can cause serious health issues, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, infants, and pregnant women. If a woman contracts LCM during pregnancy, the virus can cross the placenta and lead to congenital infection, which may result in significant neurological damage or developmental abnormalities in the fetus.

This information is intended for general understanding and is not a substitute for medical advice. Anyone experiencing symptoms consistent with LCM should consult a healthcare professional for evaluation and appropriate care. Let me know if you'd like more details on transmission, diagnosis, or treatment.","Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM) symptoms may vary widely from person to person. Some people may experience no symptoms at all, while others may experience severe symptoms. The symptoms can be divided into two phases:

1. Initial Phase: This usually starts within 6-13 days after exposure to the virus and lasts up to a week. Symptoms may include:
   - Fever
   - Malaise (general feeling of discomfort or illness)
   - Lack of appetite
   - Muscle aches
   - Headache
   - Nausea and vomiting
   - Cough
   - Sore throat
   - Chest pain

2. Second Phase: This usually starts within a few days after the initial phase ends. Symptoms may include:
   - Meningitis (inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord)
   - Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)
   - Meningoencephalitis (inflammation of both the brain and the membranes covering it)
   - Neurological conditions like dizziness, tremors, seizures
   - Temporary or permanent hearing loss
   - Unsteady gait
   - Paralysis

In severe cases, LCM can cause brain damage, inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), inflammation of the lung tissue (pneumonitis), and inflammation of the nerves in the eye (optic neuritis). It is recommended to seek medical attention if any of"
symptoms,What are the symptoms of Alkhurma Hemorrhagic Fever (AHF) ?,"Based on limited information, after an incubation period that could be as short as 2-4 days, the disease presents initially with non-specific flu-like symptoms, including fever, anorexia (loss of appetite), general malaise, diarrhea, and vomiting; a second phase has appeared in some patients, and includes neurologic and hemorrhagic symptoms in severe form. Multi-organ failure precedes fatal outcomes. No repeated or chronic symptoms have been reported following recovery. Evidence suggests that a milder form may exist, where hospitalization is not required. 
                
Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver enzymes are nearly always observed in patients who have been hospitalized.","Alkhurma Hemorrhagic Fever (AHF) is a rare but potentially severe viral illness caused by the Alkhurma virus, a member of the Flavivirus family. It has primarily been reported in Saudi Arabia and neighboring regions, with transmission thought to occur through contact with infected animals—particularly livestock—ticks, or contaminated animal products such as raw milk or meat. The illness begins suddenly, typically with nonspecific symptoms that can resemble many other viral infections. These early symptoms often include high fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and sometimes diarrhea.

As the disease progresses, more severe complications may develop. These can include bleeding manifestations such as nosebleeds, gum bleeding, or other signs of hemorrhage. Some patients may develop jaundice, indicating liver involvement, and neurological symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or even coma. Inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and liver (hepatitis) have also been reported in more severe cases. While not all individuals infected with the virus will develop life-threatening symptoms, the potential for serious complications—including death—makes early recognition and supportive care essential.

Because of the overlap with other febrile and hemorrhagic illnesses, laboratory confirmation is necessary for diagnosis. There is currently no specific antiviral treatment for Alkhurma Hemorrhagic Fever; care is supportive and aimed at managing symptoms and preventing complications. As with other viral hemorrhagic fevers, this information is not a substitute for medical advice, and anyone who may have been exposed to the virus or is experiencing similar symptoms should seek immediate medical attention. Let me know if you’d like more detail on its diagnosis, prevention, or risk factors.","Alkhurma Hemorrhagic Fever (AHF) symptoms may include:

1. High fever
2. Headache
3. Joint and muscle pain
4. Vomiting and nausea
5. Diarrhea
6. Stomach pain
7. Loss of appetite
8. Dizziness
9. Confusion or disorientation
10. Bleeding from the gums, nose, or in the stools
11. Rash
12. Jaundice
13. Seizures
14. Low blood pressure
15. Organ failure, especially liver and kidney failure.

In severe cases, AHF can lead to life-threatening complications such as encephalitis (brain inflammation) and hemorrhagic shock. Symptoms can last for a week or longer and the disease can be fatal if not treated. It's important to note that some infected persons may not show any symptoms or may have mild symptoms that can be easily mistaken for other illnesses."
symptoms,what are the signs and symptoms of rabies?,"The first symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu including general weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. These symptoms may last for days.
                
There may be also discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of bite, progressing within days to symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, agitation. As the disease progresses, the person may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, and insomnia.
                
The acute period of disease typically ends after 2 to 10 days. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, and treatment is typically supportive.
                
Disease prevention includes administration of both passive antibody, through an injection of human immune globulin and a round of injections with rabies vaccine.
                
Once a person begins to exhibit signs of the disease, survival is rare. To date less than 10 documented cases of human survival from clinical rabies have been reported and only two have not had a history of pre- or postexposure prophylaxis.","Rabies is a viral disease that affects the central nervous system and is nearly always fatal once clinical symptoms appear. It is typically transmitted to humans through the bite or scratch of an infected animal, most commonly dogs, bats, raccoons, skunks, or foxes. The virus travels through the nervous system toward the brain, and the incubation period can vary from a few weeks to several months, depending on factors such as the location of the exposure and the amount of virus introduced.

The initial signs and symptoms of rabies are often nonspecific and may resemble a mild viral illness. These early symptoms can include fever, headache, fatigue, general weakness, and discomfort or pain at the site of the bite, which may be accompanied by tingling or burning sensations. As the virus progresses and reaches the brain, more severe neurological symptoms begin to appear. These can include anxiety, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, insomnia, and difficulty swallowing. A hallmark sign of rabies is hydrophobia, or fear of water, due to painful spasms in the throat when attempting to drink. As the disease advances, patients may develop paralysis, seizures, and eventually lapse into coma.

There are two main forms of rabies: the more common encephalitic or ""furious"" rabies, which is marked by hyperactivity, aggression, and fluctuating consciousness, and the paralytic or ""dumb"" form, which progresses more slowly and is characterized by muscle weakness and eventual paralysis. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is almost always fatal. However, rabies is entirely preventable if appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is administered promptly after exposure. This information is not medical advice; anyone who may have been exposed to rabies should seek immediate medical evaluation to determine the appropriate course of action.






","Symptoms of rabies in humans typically appear after an incubation period of one to three months but can emerge in as little as a week or as long as a year. The symptoms can be divided into two stages: the prodromal stage and the excitation stage.

Prodromal stage symptoms include:

1. Fever
2. Headache
3. Anxiety or irritability
4. Pain or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of the bite

Excitation stage symptoms include:

1. Agitation or restlessness
2. Confusion
3. Hallucinations
4. Excessive salivation or foaming at the mouth
5. Difficulty swallowing or fear of water (hydrophobia)
6. Partial paralysis, often leading to complete paralysis
7. Insomnia

Eventually, rabies can cause respiratory failure leading to death. It's important to note that once symptoms appear, rabies is almost always fatal. 

In animals, signs of rabies may include a change in behavior (like aggression in a normally docile animal), difficulty walking, excessive salivation, and sometimes, self-mutilation at the site of the bite."
symptoms,what are the symptoms of botulism?,"The classic symptoms of botulism include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. Infants with botulism appear lethargic, feed poorly, are constipated, and have a weak cry and poor muscle tone. These are all symptoms of the muscle paralysis caused by the bacterial toxin. If untreated, these symptoms may progress to cause paralysis of the respiratory muscles, arms, legs, and trunk. In foodborne botulism, symptoms generally begin 18 to 36 hours after eating a contaminated food, but they can occur as early as 6 hours or as late as 10 days.","Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by toxins produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Symptoms typically begin 12 to 36 hours after exposure, though they can appear as early as a few hours or as late as several days. Initial signs include difficulty swallowing or speaking, dry mouth, facial weakness on both sides, blurred or double vision, and drooping eyelids. As the toxin affects the nervous system, individuals may experience trouble breathing, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and, in severe cases, paralysis. Wound botulism presents similarly but may also include localized pain and swelling at the infection site. Prompt medical attention is crucial, as botulism can be life-threatening without treatment.","1. Difficulty swallowing or speaking
2. Dry mouth
3. Facial weakness on both sides of the face
4. Blurred or double vision
5. Drooping eyelids
6. Difficulty breathing
7. Nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps
8. Paralysis
9. Weakness with muscle fatigue
10. Changes in heart rate and blood pressure
Remember, botulism is a rare but serious illness that can lead to paralysis. If you suspect you may have botulism, seek medical attention immediately."
symptoms,What are the symptoms of Marburg hemorrhagic fever (Marburg HF) ?,"After an incubation period of 5-10 days, symptom onset is sudden and marked by fever, chills, headache, and myalgia. Around the fifth day after the onset of symptoms, a maculopapular rash, most prominent on the trunk (chest, back, stomach), may occur. Nausea, vomiting, chest pain, a sore throat, abdominal pain, and diarrhea may then appear. Symptoms become increasingly severe and can include jaundice, inflammation of the pancreas, severe weight loss, delirium, shock, liver failure, massive hemorrhaging, and multi-organ dysfunction. 
 
Because many of the signs and symptoms of Marburg hemorrhagic fever are similar to those of other infectious diseases such as malaria or typhoid fever, clinical diagnosis of the disease can be difficult, especially if only a single case is involved. 
 
The case-fatality rate for Marburg hemorrhagic fever is between 23-90%. For a complete listing of the case fatality rates for previous outbreaks, please see the History of Outbreaks table","Marburg hemorrhagic fever (Marburg HF) is a severe and often fatal illness caused by the Marburg virus, a member of the filovirus family, which also includes the Ebola virus. The symptoms of Marburg HF typically begin abruptly, following an incubation period of 2 to 21 days after exposure. Initial symptoms often resemble those of many other infectious diseases and include a sudden onset of high fever, severe headache, muscle aches, and general malaise. As the disease progresses, more serious symptoms develop, including severe watery diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping, nausea, and vomiting—these gastrointestinal symptoms often appear within the first week of illness and may be accompanied by weight loss, lethargy, and extreme weakness. In the more severe stages, patients may experience hemorrhagic manifestations such as bleeding from the gums, nose, eyes, or gastrointestinal tract, along with bruising and internal bleeding. Rash, delirium, liver failure, and multi-organ dysfunction can also occur. Due to the non-specific nature of early symptoms and the rapid progression of the disease, Marburg HF requires urgent medical evaluation and isolation protocols to prevent transmission. It is important to note that this information is not a substitute for medical advice; individuals experiencing symptoms or with potential exposure should seek immediate care from a healthcare professional.","Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever (Marburg HF) is a severe and highly fatal disease caused by a virus from the same family as the one that causes Ebola HF. Symptoms of Marburg HF typically include:

1. High fever
2. Severe headache
3. Joint and muscle aches
4. Chills
5. Weakness

Over time, these symptoms can become more severe and may include:

1. Nausea and vomiting
2. Diarrhea (may be bloody)
3. Red eyes
4. Raised rash
5. Chest pain and cough
6. Stomach pain
7. Severe weight loss
8. Jaundice (yellow skin and eyes)
9. Delirium
10. Liver failure
11. Massive hemorrhaging (bleeding)

In severe cases, the patient may experience multiple organ failure and shock, often leading to death. Symptoms usually appear abruptly within 5 to 10 days after exposure to the virus."
